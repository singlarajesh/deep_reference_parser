description = Multitask model trained on a combination of Reach and Rodrigues 
    data. The Rodrigues data have been concatenated into a single continuous
    document and then cut into sequences of length=line_length, so that the
    Rodrigues data and Reach data have the same lengths without need for much
    padding or truncating.
