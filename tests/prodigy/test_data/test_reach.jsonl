Health services in England and Wales have organisational arrangements in place for securing\nimprovements in cancer services and those responsible for their operation should take this guidance into account\nwhen planning, commissioning and organising services for cancer patients. The recommendations in the guidance\nconcentrate on aspects of services that are likely to have significant impact on health outcomes. Both the\nanticipated benefits and the resource implications of implementing the recommendations are considered. This\nguidance can be used to identify gaps in local provision and to check the appropriateness of existing services.\nReferences\n1.\nDepartment of Health (2001)  The NHS Cancer Plan.

It deals with a relatively frequent group of\ncancers, one of which (prostate cancer) has become the subject of\nincreasing patient group and political interest.  This is seen by some\nas a prime men\u2019s health issue and it has become a focus for\nincreasing awareness among men of the possibility of cancer.\nTo those members of the National Cancer Guidance Steering Group\nwho have been in this venture from the beginning, the experience of\npreparing each successive guidance document has revealed\nsomething of a pattern in the way cancer site-specific services\ndevelop over time.  Familiar issues arise with each cancer site, issues\non which the Group has already published recommendations in\nguidance on services for other cancer sites.  It seems that new\npatterns of practice, adopted by services for one cancer, may not be\nactively considered by those involved in delivering services for\ndifferent cancers.  \nThe widely accepted features of modern cancer care were set out in\nthe Calman-Hine report, and those principles have been influential in\nthe most recent statement of national policy in England, the NHS\nCancer Plan , and in the  Cameron Report  in Wales.  Most of the\nrecommendations in Calman-Hine were first applied to breast cancer\nservices, and have subsequently been adapted in developing services\nfor other common cancers such as colorectal and lung.  \nWhilst there are honourable exceptions, urological cancer services in\ngeneral have lagged behind in adopting these principles, although\nthere are encouraging signs that this has begun to change.  For\nexample, properly constituted multidisciplinary clinical teams (MDTs)\nare less common in urology than in some other areas.  In both\nsurgery and non-surgical oncology for urological malignancies, care is\noften fragmented, with most individuals handling cases outside formal\nMDTs.  This guidance provides the impetus to change this state of\naffairs.\nSo what are these predictable common themes?  The first can best be\ndescribed as an \u2018awakening\u2019: a growing recognition, often expressed\nby patient groups as well as influential professionals in the field\nconcerned, of the variability and deficiencies in current organisation\nand delivery of clinical care to patients.  Awareness that the delivery\nof services needs to become more consistent and coherent opens the\nway to change. \nThe second is the crucial importance of the diagnostic and referral\nprocess.  Reliable and thorough diagnosis is the cornerstone of good\nclinical cancer care.  Optimum decisions on management depend on\nthe accurate, reliable, and comprehensive diagnosis and staging of\ndisease.  Without all the relevant information, of a quality that can be\nrelied on, those involved in decisions on clinical management are\ndisadvantaged, as are their patients.  Important weaknesses have been\nfound in urological cancer diagnostics - as there were in diagnostic\nservices for breast and other common cancers.  Site-specific cancer\nservices need the involvement of diagnostic specialists working\ncarefully to modern protocols.  Improvements in services for specific\ncancers require diagnostic specialisation and professional continuity,\nwith the full involvement of these individuals in multidisciplinary\nworking.  Urological malignancies are no exception.  Putting this\nemphasis on the importance of the diagnostic contribution is\njustifiable notwithstanding an acknowledged and serious shortfall in\nthe supply of qualified individuals in the relevant disciplines.\nAddressing this will inevitably take time, but it remains a critical\nobjective.\nThe next recurring theme is the way in which decisions on the\nmanagement of individual patients are best taken.  Multidisciplinary\nteams which involve all the different professions and disciplines\nrequired for each group of cancers need to be assembled.  Getting\nthese teams to work together effectively, and supporting their\nactivities, is the key to doing this well.  The skills of all the members\nare important to clinical decision-making, which then becomes a\ncollective process. \nAnother common strand is the importance of defining the natural\nsequence of events in the organisation and delivery of care.  The\nprocesses from first referral through to arrangements to manage\nrecurrent and advanced disease have to reflect the needs of the\npatient at various stages.  This is a major driver to shape the way\nservices are organised and delivered.  Such ideas are not by any\nmeans the sole province of this guidance.  There has been huge\ninterest in defining pathways of care and thinking through patient\njourneys.  The Cancer Services Collaborative in England has\nencouraged fresh thinking on many of the logistic and organisational\nissues which professionals face in delivering care to their patients.\nThe final theme that occurs remorselessly is the need to determine\nwhether there are any aspects of service - often, but not exclusively,\ndealing with rare forms of disease or complex procedures - which\nwould be best provided for larger populations and caseloads than can\n4\nbe managed by local services.  This has proved to be a crucial factor\nin shaping the service pattern for cancers of intermediate frequency.\nThere are inevitably vested interests amongst the clinical communities\nconcerned, and sometimes tensions between those who favour one\nmodel or another.  Whilst evidence on these matters is not always\nprofuse, it does exist, and has to be carefully considered for each\ngroup of cancers.  We have been struck by the consistency between\nresults of studies on different cancers.\nThe evidence base for managing urological malignancies is less\ncomprehensive and in some important clinical areas, less clear, than\nfor many other cancers.  This has made the task of reviewing\nevidence particularly difficult.  It is an appropriate point to gratefully\nacknowledge the huge contribution made by external reviewers to\nthese guidance documents.  \nA new and important feature of the implementation process is the\nrecent advent of National Cancer Standards in England and the\nMinimum Standards for Cancer Services in Wales.  Key features of\neach guidance document will be incorporated in future revisions of\nthese standards, expanding the range of the accompanying peer\nreviews.  Implementation is the prime function of cancer networks,\ntoo, supported by the rollout of the Cancer Services Collaborative in\nEngland.  This Guidance uses the results from some Collaborative\nprojects as evidence; it is the first time this has been available to us.  \nTaken together, the service context for implementing guidance has\nadvanced very considerably since the early years following\npublication of Calman-Hine.  There is now systematic support for the\nimplementation of the  Cancer Plan  in England and the  Cameron\nReport  in Wales, of which this guidance is only one element.\nTogether these will help to realise one of the original goals of\nCalman-Hine, which was (and remains) arguably the single most\ncrucial objective:-\n\u2018All patients should have access to a uniformly high\nquality of care in the community or hospital\nwherever they may live to ensure the maximum\npossible cure rates and best quality of life.  Care\nshould be provided as close to the patient\u2019s home as\nis compatible with high quality, safe and effective\ntreatment\u2019.\n.\n5\nKey recommendations\nThe key recommendations highlight the main organisational issues specific to\nurological cancers that are central to implementing the guidance. As such, they may\ninvolve major changes to current practice. \n\u2022\nAll patients with urological cancers should be managed by\nmultidisciplinary urological cancer teams.  These teams should\nfunction in the context of dedicated specialist services, with\nworking arrangements and protocols agreed throughout each\ncancer network.  Patients should be specifically assured of:\n\u2022\nStreamlined services, designed to minimise delays;\n\u2022\nBalanced information about management options for their\ncondition;\n\u2022\nImproved management for progressive and recurrent disease.\n\u2022\nMembers of urological cancer teams should have specialised skills\nappropriate for their roles at each level of the service.  Within\neach network, multidisciplinary teams should be formed in local\nhospitals (cancer units); at cancer centres, with the possibility in\nlarger networks of additional specialist teams serving populations\nof at least one million; and at supra-network level to provide\nspecialist management for some male genital cancers.\n\u2022\nRadical surgery for prostate and bladder cancer should be\nprovided by teams typically serving populations of one million or\nmore and carrying out a cumulative total of at least 50 such\noperations per annum.  Whilst these teams are being established,\nsurgeons carrying out small numbers (five or fewer per annum)\nof either operation should make arrangements within their\nnetwork to pass this work on to more specialised colleagues.\n\u2022\nMajor improvements are required in information and support\nservices for patients and carers.  Nurse specialist members of\nurological cancer teams will have key roles in these services.\n\u2022\nThere are many areas of uncertainty about the optimum form of\ntreatment for patients with urological cancers.  High-quality\nresearch studies should be supported, with encouragement of\ngreater rates of participation in clinical trials. \n6\nBackground\nIncidence and mortality\nThe group of diseases with which this Manual deals \u2013 cancers of the\nprostate, testis, penis, kidney and bladder \u2013 account for 16.5% of all\nnew cases of cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and 11.7%\nof cancer deaths.\n1\n,\n2\nProstate cancer is the second most frequently\ndiagnosed cancer among men of all ages; testicular cancer, although\nrelatively infrequent, is nevertheless the most common cancer in men\nunder 45 years of age.  Cancer of the penis, by contrast, is rare.\nCancers of the kidney and bladder may develop in people of either\nsex but are roughly twice as common among men (Table 1).\nNumbers of deaths and mortality rates are shown in Table 2. \nTable 1.

But whilst it may be useful for\nservice planning to lump together all the cancers considered in this\nManual, the patterns of care required for each cancer site vary widely\nbecause these cancers are very different in nature and characteristics.  \nProstate cancer is particularly common among elderly men; two thirds\nof those who die from prostate cancer are over the age of 75.\n3\nAutopsy studies reveal that the majority of men over 80 years old have\nareas of malignant tissue in their prostate glands; most die  with  it, not\nof  it.\n4\nProstate cancer may be identified as a result of investigations or\nintervention for symptoms related to benign prostate disease, also a\nvery common condition in elderly men.  However, when prostate\ncancer develops in younger men, it seems to have a more aggressive\nnature.  Relatively few of the 40-49 age-group are affected, but these\nmen have the highest mortality rate.\n3\n8\n3\nQuinn M, Babb P, Brock A , et al.

It is predominantly found in young\nmen, with a modal age at diagnosis of about 30.\n5\nIt may be\nassociated with developmental abnormalities of the urogenital system. \nCancers of the kidney, bladder and associated urinary organs are\nneither especially common nor rare.  They are most likely to occur in\nmen aged between 60 and 80 years.  Penis cancer tends to affect the\nsame age-group.\n2\nIn a single year, the average GP, with a list of 2,000 patients, is likely\nto see one or two new patients with one of these cancers per year.  A\nnotional average district general hospital (DGH), serving a population\nof 200,000, deals with roughly 70 men with prostate cancer, 6 with\ntesticular cancer, perhaps 20 people with kidney and 50 with bladder\ncancer \u2013 a total of around 150 new patients per year with urological\ncancers.  Figures for prostate cancer incidence show particularly wide\ngeographical variations because more cases are identified when\npatients and clinicians search more aggressively for it.  \nFive-year survival rates are shown in Table 3.  Although there has\nbeen little overall change in these rates between patient groups\ndiagnosed in 1986-90 and 1991-93, the significant improvement for\nmen with testicular cancer \u2013 a rise in five-year survival rates from\n91.2% to 94.5% \u2013 is notable in view of the small amount of room for\nsuch improvement.  The 7% improvement in prostate cancer survival\nrates is, however, likely to be due more to lead time and length time\nbiases associated with increasing use of prostate specific antigen\n(PSA) testing than to improvements in treatment.\n2\n9\n5\nUnited Kingdom Testicular Cancer Study Group.

It is possible that they are associated with earlier\ndiagnosis in some parts of Europe, where greater use of imaging will\ntend to increase the rate of detection of small (incidental) kidney\ntumours and widespread PSA testing will reveal more early prostate\ncancers.  The apparent survival differences could therefore be due, at\nleast in part, to length and lead-time biases.  \n10\n6\nBerrino F, Sant M, Verdecchia A , et al.

Some present with symptoms such as bone pain, which\nmay not be immediately recognised as due to metastatic urological\ncancer, and some are referred by geriatricians. \nThe main presenting symptoms of primary urological tumours fall into\nthree groups: lower urinary tract symptoms, haematuria, and\nsuspicious lumps.  Lower urinary tract symptoms are relatively\ncommon.  In older men, they are often due to benign prostatic\nhyperplasia, which is at least four times as common as prostate cancer\nand may co-exist with it.\n4\n,\n7\nCancer is very unlikely to be the cause of\nsuch symptoms in younger men or women, but persistent problems\nthat fail to respond to antibiotics are occasionally due to bladder\ncancer.\nHaematuria, or blood in the urine, is the most common symptom of\nboth bladder and kidney cancer.  Around one patient in five who\ndevelops visible haematuria is likely to have urological \u2013 usually\nbladder \u2013 cancer.\n8\n,\n9\nWhilst population studies suggest that\n11\n7\nChamberlain J, Melia J, Moss S , et al.

It is diagnosed increasingly frequently when imaging, carried\nout for some other reason, reveals a mass in the kidney.  A recent\n(unpublished) audit in north west England reported that in 37% of\npatients with kidney cancer, the tumour was an incidental finding.\n13\nMost patients with testicular cancers present with a lump in the\nscrotum, usually detected initially by the man himself or by his\npartner. \nEpidemiology, trends and treatment \nProstate cancer\nRegistration and mortality rates for prostate cancer have been\nincreasing (Figure 1), although how great the true increase in\nincidence may be is not clear because early, asymptomatic disease is\nmore likely to be diagnosed than in previous decades.  The main\nreason for this is the use of PSA testing, which became commonplace\nduring the last decade.  Despite this, about a quarter of patients in\nthe UK have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis (Table 5); in\nthese cases, bone pain caused by metastatic cancer may prompt the\ninitial consultation. \nBoth diagnosis and mortality rates began to fall again after 1995 (see\nFigure 1).  Current trends in diagnosis rates are unclear, but even if\nthese do not rise, the ageing of the population means that the\nnumber of men with prostate cancer can be expected to increase to\naround 22,000 by 2011 (figures extrapolated from Chamberlain  et al ,\n1997\n7\n).

One recent change to policy was the decision that PSA\ntests should be available to men who request them, but that they\nshould first be provided with clear information about the test and the\nuncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks of screening for\nprostate cancer.  This information is now available on the National\nelectronic Library for Prostate Cancer.\n14\nNeither the causes of prostate cancer nor the reasons for the increase\nin mortality rate over the past thirty years are known, although some\nrisk factors have been identified.  Hormones are important; meta-\nanalysis of cohort and case-control studies show that men with serum\ntestosterone levels in the highest quartile are 2.3 (95% CI: 1.3 to 4.2)\ntimes as likely to develop prostate cancer as those in the lowest\nquartile.  High levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) are\nassociated with a similar increase in risk.\n15\nGenetic factors are important in about 9% of cases, particularly when\nthe disease develops at a young age.  The risk is doubled when a\nman has one close relative with this cancer and it increases with the\nnumber of relatives affected.\n16\nIncreased risk has also been linked\nwith a family history of breast cancer.\nA suggested association between vasectomy and prostate cancer was\nnot confirmed by a thorough systematic review and meta-analysis of\nresearch evidence.\n17\nThere are wide international variations in the incidence of clinically-\nevident prostate cancer.

Decreased\nrisk is associated with a high intake of vegetables rich in carotenoids,\nparticularly tomatoes.\n18\n,\n19\n,\n20\n,\n21\nFish also seems to be protective.\n22\nIncreased risk is associated with diets high in animal fat;\n19\nthis might\nbe linked with bio-concentration in animal fat of agricultural\nchemicals which affect hormone levels.\n23\nEvidence that high\nconsumption of dairy products can double the risk of prostate cancer\n(especially advanced disease), even after controlling for fat intake, has\nled to the development of a yet another hypothesis: that high calcium\nintake may promote these tumours.\n24\nThe true reasons for the higher\nrisk associated with dietary patterns of northern Europe, North\nAmerica and Australasia remain unknown.\nProstate cancer may be detected by PSA testing, digital rectal\nexamination (DRE), and trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy.\nTumour may also be found by pathological examination of tissue\nsamples after trans-urethral resection of the prostrate (TURP) carried\nout to relieve urinary obstruction.  \nThe disease usually progresses slowly, but prognosis depends heavily\non the grade of the tumour.  This is assessed using the Gleason\nscoring system.  Gleason scores range from 2 to 10; more aggressive\ncancers, which spread faster beyond the prostate, have higher scores.\nAudit data from north west England (unpublished) suggests that two-\nthirds of new patients have moderately differentiated tumours, with\nGleason scores of 5 to 7; the remainder are roughly equally divided\nbetween the lower and higher ranges of the scale.\n13\nThe Gleason\nscore is used in combination with PSA level and information on local\ntumour spread gained from DRE and TRUS to assess prognosis. \n19\nWorld Cancer Research Fund.

Radical treatment is associated with\nsignificant complications, particularly impotence and incontinence;\nand whilst it can control local symptoms, there is no clear evidence\nshowing whether it improves survival.  Hormone treatment reduces\nthe rate of progression of the cancer and may be used in combination\nwith other forms of treatment or as the primary intervention; however,\nit also causes loss of libido and impotence.  Active monitoring is\nparticularly appropriate for men whose tumours are not expected to\ncause problems in their lifetime, either because their life-expectancy is\nrelatively short or because the cancer is small and growing only\nslowly.\n4\nThe main problems in advanced prostate cancer are lower urinary\ntract symptoms and pain due to metastatic disease, predominantly in\nbones.  Palliative interventions include hormone treatment,\nradiotherapy and analgesia.\nTesticular cancer\nThere has been a continuous rise in the incidence of testicular cancer\nover the past few decades.  A large case-control study in England and\nWales has elucidated some aspects of the aetiology of this disease; it\nrevealed significant associations with congenital abnormalities,\nparticularly undescended testes, early age at puberty, and sedentary\nlifestyle.\n5\nThe incidence of undescended testes \u2013 linked with a four-\nfold increase in risk (odds ratio 3.82, 95% CI: 2.24 to 6.52) \u2013 has also\nbeen increasing.  Family members of men with testicular cancer are at\nincreased risk; the probability that a brother of an affected man will\ndevelop the disease by the age of 50 is around 2% - 10 times the\ngeneral population risk.\n26\nThe majority of cases are identified at an\nearly stage, however, (Table 6) and this form of cancer can usually be\ncured even when it has spread beyond the testis.\n16\n25\nLu-Yao G, Yao S.

Br J Cancer  1992; 65 :255-\n62.\nThere is a widespread belief among health professionals that young\nmen should be educated to examine their testes for lumps in order\nthat any cancer might be treated as quickly as possible.  But young\nmen are notoriously disinterested in health.  Few examine themselves\neven after specific teaching, and there is no evidence that educational\ninterventions intended to encourage them to do so are effective.\n27\nThere are two main types of testicular tumour, seminoma and non-\nseminoma.  Surgery is used to treat both types and may be sufficient\nto control the disease, but patients with seminoma may be treated\nwith post-operative radiotherapy, whilst chemotherapy is more\nappropriate for patients with non-seminomas.  Success rates are high\n\u2013 fewer than 10% of patients die from testicular cancer \u2013 but the\nproblem may recur: up to 5% of men develop cancer in the\nremaining testis within 25 years of the initial diagnosis.\n28\nTable 6.

However, there is accumulating\nevidence suggesting that infection with human papillomavirus (HPV\nor genital warts) may be involved in many cases.\n29\nA North American\ncase-control study found that the risk for men with a history of such\ninfection was six times that in age-matched controls, and that 49% of\ntumours contained HPV genetic material.\n30\nOther factors which\nincreased risk three-fold or more were smoking; lack of, or late,\ncircumcision; and a history of penile rash or tear. \n17\n27\nRosella JD.

Usually, there is a painless\nulcer or growth, most often on the glans or foreskin, but some men\ndevelop a rash, bumps or flat growths on the penis and there may be\nfoul-smelling discharge under the foreskin.  Diagnosis is by biopsy.\nThe most common treatment is surgery but radiotherapy may be an\noption.  Topical chemotherapy or laser treatment can be used for\nsuperficial tumours (carcinoma in situ).  Radiotherapy or systemic\nchemotherapy can be used for palliation in metastatic disease.\nBladder cancer\nThe most common causes of bladder cancer are carcinogenic\nchemicals \u2013 particularly aromatic amines \u2013 in urine.  An important\nsource of such carcinogens is cigarette smoke, and there is a\nsignificant dose-response relationship between the lifetime number of\ncigarettes smoked and the risk of bladder cancer.  Meta-analysis of\ndata from 43 studies reveals that, compared with non-smokers,\ncurrent smokers face three times the risk of developing urinary tract\ncancers (odds ratio 3.33; 95% CI: 2.63 to 4.21), whilst for ex-smokers,\nthe risk is doubled (odds ratio 1.98; 95% CI: 1.72 to 2.29).\n31\nCurrent\ncigarette smokers are two to five times more likely to develop bladder\ncancer than non-smokers, the level of risk increasing among heavier\nsmokers; but quitting leads to a 30-60% fall in risk within four\nyears.\n32,33\nSince rates of smoking have been falling faster among men\nthan women, it is possible that the difference between the sexes in\nbladder cancer rates could decrease, as with lung cancer.\nUp to 20% of bladder cancers may be caused by exposure to\nchemicals in the workplace.\n34\nThese can cause bladder cancer five to\n50 (typically, 10-15) years later.  The highest risk is again associated\nwith aromatic amines, which used to be commonplace in dyes, paints\nand plastics and are currently found in diesel exhaust fumes and\nother industrial by-products. \nOccupations associated with increased risk include work in textile,\ndyestuffs, chemical or plastics industries; tyre and rubber manufacture;\ntruck and taxi driving; painting and printing; metalwork; work in the\ncable industry; leather work and hairdressing.\n32,34\n18\n31\nZeegers M, Tan F, Dorant E , et al.

Other\ncauses include previous treatment for cancer \u2013 in particular,\nradiotherapy to the pelvis and some forms of chemotherapy.  Long-\nterm use of chlorinated drinking water may increase the risk up to\ntwo-fold.\n32\n95% of patients present with haematuria and cancer can be detected\nusing a cystoscope to view the inside of the bladder.  The staging\nsystem for bladder cancer is summarised in Table 7. \nIn about three quarters of new cases, the cancers are superficial and\ncan be removed by surgery carried out through the urethra (trans-\nurethral resection, or TUR).  Irrigation of the bladder with\nimmunotherapeutic or chemotherapeutic agents may be used to\nreduce the probability of recurrence of superficial cancers.  Surgery,\nradiotherapy and, increasingly, chemotherapy, are used to treat\ninvasive tumours.  Metastatic disease may be widespread, affecting\nlymph nodes, liver, lungs and bones.\nTable 7.

The most common form is renal cell cancer,\nwhich accounts for over 80% of cases in England and Wales.  The\nother main form of kidney cancer (transitional cell carcinoma) affects\nthe renal pelvis; similar tumours can also develop in the ureters.\nWhere this Manual refers to kidney cancer without further\nspecification, it should be assumed to mean renal cell cancer.\nOver two decades from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, the incidence\nof renal cell cancer rose by about 3% per annum in the US\n36\nand 2.5%\nper annum in northern England.\n37\nThe English data show an 86%\nage-standardised increase between 1978 and 1997.  Whilst part of this\nrise is likely to be due to increased detection of early, pre-\nsymptomatic tumours by imaging, this does not account for much of\nthe change in incidence.  \nA quarter of kidney cancers are believed to be directly attributable to\nsmoking; smokers are more than twice as likely to develop renal cell\ncancer and four times as likely to develop cancer of the renal pelvis\nas non-smokers.\n38\nRenal cell cancer is more common in obese\npeople, and is independently associated with hypertension.\n39\nIn\nMinnesota, these three risk factors together account for half of all\ncases.\n40\nWhilst there are other known risk factors, such as exposure to\ncadmium and the once-popular analgesic phenacetin,\n38,41\ntheir impact\non kidney cancer incidence in the population as a whole is much less\nthan that of obesity, hypertension and smoking.\nSome kidney cancers are due to genetic influences.  Two rare\nconditions associated with specific mutations are von Hippel-Lindau\nsyndrome, which increases the risk of kidney and other cancers, and\nWilms\u2019 Tumour, which affects children.  In addition, a family history\nof renal cell cancer is associated with increased risk.  \n20\n36\nChow WH, Devesa SS, Warren JL , et al.  Rising incidence of renal cell cancer in the United\nStates.

More advanced tumours\ncan cause haematuria, back pain, and an abdominal mass.  Renal cell\ncancers may also cause fever.  \nTreatment is primarily surgical.  These cancers tend not to respond to\nchemotherapy although immunotherapy is sometimes effective.\nMetastatic spread may involve lymph nodes, bones, liver, lungs, brain\nand other organs.\nPrevention\nThe evidence on risk factors for this group of cancers suggests that\nthere is substantial scope for prevention.  Population-wide initiatives\naimed at reducing smoking and improving diet are highlighted as\ngovernment priorities.  These could lead to substantial reductions in\nthe number of people who develop urological cancers.\nHalf the cases of urinary tract (bladder or kidney) cancer in men and\na third of cases in women are likely to be due to smoking.\n31\nEffective\ninterventions for reducing smoking are described in the document on\nlung cancer in this series ( Improving Outcomes in Lung Cancer: The\nManual) .  It is unlikely, however, that prostate cancer rates would be\naffected significantly by action against smoking.\n42\nDietary\nimprovements \u2013 specifically, increased consumption of vegetables and\nfish, and decreased consumption of dairy produce and meat \u2013 might\nreduce the prevalence of symptomatic prostate cancer.\n19,43\nIncreased\nfruit and vegetable consumption is also likely to reduce the risk of\nother urological cancers.\n19,44\nFinally, interventions to reduce obesity\nand hypertension could reduce the prevalence of kidney cancer.\n40\nThere is no reliable evidence showing that population screening\nreduces mortality rates from any form of urological cancer.\nSystematic reviews have concluded that screening for prostate cancer\nusing PSA testing cannot be justified on the basis of current\nevidence.\n4,7 \n21\n42\nLumey LH.

Cancer Causes Control  1996; 7 :95-100.\nCurrent services in the NHS\nOne of the problems that has been highlighted in urological cancer\nservices is the delay between referral and diagnosis.  Long delays are\nrelatively common, particularly for patients with cancers of the\nprostate, bladder, renal pelvis and ureter.  33% of patients referred by\nGPs to urologists have to wait for more than 12 weeks between\nreferral and diagnosis; 12% wait more than 24 weeks.  Table 8 shows\nthe length of delay for 15,543 patients after referral to urologists.\n35\nThese figures suggest that there are major problems with urological\ndiagnostic services.\nTable 8.  Time between referral to urologist and diagnosis \n(excluding patients diagnosed before referral)\nStructure and quality of current services\nPatients with the more common urological cancers are managed by\nurologists working in local district general hospitals, sometimes in\ncollaboration with oncologists.  Co-ordinated multidisciplinary team\nstructures are not common in urology.\nThere is little information on the quality of current services but there is\nevidence that delays in diagnosis and treatment are greater for patients\nwith prostate and bladder cancers than for those with other common\ncancers.  Both time to first out-patient appointment and time to first\ndefinitive treatment are, in general, substantially longer for prostate and\nbladder cancer than for breast, colorectal, lung, gynaecological, or\nupper gastro-intestinal cancers.  A study of waiting times for all patients\nnewly diagnosed with cancer in 1997 found that men with prostate\ncancer endured the longest delays - 53 days (median) to first definitive\ntreatment for cases referred as urgent, 111 days for non-urgent cases.\n45\n22\nOrgan\nMean (days)\nMedian (days)\nProstate\n115\n60\nBladder\n83\n54\nKidney\n67\n38\nTestis\n27\n13\nKidney pelvis/\nureter\n117\n64\nPenis\n52\n33\n45\nSpurgeon P, Barwell F, Kerr D.

Local hospitals will need to\ncollaborate to generate the workload necessary to support increased\nspecialisation among urologists, a minority of whom will develop\nexpertise in the management of urological cancers.  \nEach network will include the following key parts:\n\u2022\nGPs/primary care teams.  The management of patients with\nprostate cancer, in particular, requires considerable primary care\ninvolvement since many of the men affected live with slowly\nadvancing cancer for years.\n\u2022\nDedicated clinics in local district general hospitals which have\nboth urology services and cancer units; these will be responsible\nfor rapid diagnosis and initial assessment.\n\u2022\nTreatment and palliative care services at local hospitals, where\npatients will be managed by multidisciplinary teams.\n\u2022\nSupport and information services for patients and carers.  These\nwill be linked with social services, particularly services for the\nelderly.\n\u2022\nSpecialised palliative care services and facilities such as\nhospices, which may be provided in partnership with the\nvoluntary sector.\n\u2022\nSpecialist multidisciplinary teams, most of which will be based\nin cancer centres, providing more technically challenging forms\nof treatment for selected patients.  Most networks will have one\nsuch team; larger networks may have two.\n\u2022\nSpecialist services at supra-network level which will manage\npatients with testicular, penile, and complicated kidney cancers.\nRepresentatives from the whole network will work with members of\nspecialist urological cancer teams to develop treatment and referral\nprotocols and ensure that the service works in a co-ordinated way.\nNon-surgical oncologists will work across networks, providing\nservices at the local level. \n24\nThe urological cancer\nnetwork and\nmultidisciplinary\nteams \nA. Recommendations\nThe network\nEach cancer network provides and co-ordinates a wide range of\nservices for patients with urological cancers within a defined\ngeographical area.  Different degrees of specialisation are required to\ndeal with the various types of cancer, and multidisciplinary teams\n(MDTs) should be established in cancer units, cancer centres, and at\nsupra-network level; these will be distinct teams, although there is\nlikely to be overlap between their members.  All teams should\nparticipate fully in the urological cancer network, and all members of\nteams should be involved in discussions on local policy decisions and\nin auditing adherence to them.\nAll patients with urological cancer \u2013 both new and existing \u2013 should be\nmanaged by appropriate MDTs.  Documented clinical policies for\nreferral and treatment should be agreed between cancer leads in\nprimary care and lead clinicians representing urological, oncology and\npalliative care services throughout the network, and signed off by the\nlead clinician for the network.  Effective systems will be required to\nensure rapid communication and efficient co-ordination between teams.\nLocal urological cancer teams should be established in cancer units at\ndistrict general hospitals.  Specialist urological cancer teams should be\nbased in larger hospitals, usually cancer centres.  There are various\npossible ways of providing local services which meet the criteria\ndefined in this Manual; local teams may be set up by individual\nTrusts; two or more Trusts may work in partnership; and some\nservices could be provided by mobile teams.  Although there should\nnot be more than one MDT of any specific type working in a single\nhospital, a centre serving a large population may have teams at\ndifferent levels of specialisation.  \nSubstantial changes in working practice will be required to create the\nform of service described here.  Each network should decide how it\nwill establish the specialist teams which are central to these\nrecommendations.  Some clinicians working in cancer units may wish\n25\n1\nto join a specialist urological cancer team based in another hospital;\nwhere this pattern of practice is adopted, all such individuals should\nparticipate fully in team meetings.  All teams should include sufficient\nmembers to allow for adequate cover for the absence of any individuals\nand all members should meet the attendance criterion (attending more\nthan half of the meetings of the team in which they work).  \nIt is recognised that a period of transition will be required before the\nnew pattern of service provision is established.  In the meantime, all\nsurgeons who carry out fewer than five radical prostatectomies or\nfewer than five cystectomies per year should pass this work to more\nspecialised colleagues. \nThe local urological cancer team \nIn general, local urological cancer teams should serve populations of\n250,000 to 500,000, but the minimum figure may be closer to 200,000\nin large sparsely populated areas.  Core teams should include, at a\nminimum, the members specified below.  All members of each team\nshould have a particular interest in urological cancer and treatment\nshould be provided by these designated individuals. \nThose who are directly involved in treating patients (in particular,\nurologists, oncologists and cancer care nurses) should recognise that\nthey have responsibility for good communication with patients and\ncarers, and should receive specific training in communication skills.  \nMembers of the local urological cancer team\n\u2022\nDesignated lead clinician (normally a consultant urologist) who\nwill take overall responsibility for the service.\n\u2022\nUrologists.

Pathology reports should include all the\ninformation required by the current Royal College of\nPathologists\u2019 minimum dataset for the relevant cancer.\n47\nA\nnational histopathology quality assurance (EQA) scheme should\nbe established along the lines of the EQA scheme for breast\ncancer, to be run by those directly involved in this work.\n\u2022\nOncologist with expertise in radiotherapy and chemotherapy for\npatients with urological cancers.  The oncologist, who is likely\nto be a member of the specialist urological cancer team from a\nlinked cancer centre, should co-operate with other specialist\noncologists in the network. \n\u2022\nPalliative care specialist (physician or nurse).\n\u2022\nTeam co-ordinator (see below,  Organisation of MDT meetings,\nfor discussion of this role).  \n\u2022\nTeam secretary who will provide clerical support for the MDT.\nThe secretary should record all decisions made by the team and\ncommunicate appropriate information promptly to all those\n(such as GPs) who may require it.  The roles of secretary and\nco-ordinator overlap and one person may be able to cover both\nfunctions in smaller teams.\nThe role of the local urological cancer team\nThis team will:\n\u2022\nProvide a rapid diagnostic and assessment service; \n\u2022\nIdentify and manage all patients with urological cancers,\nincluding those cared for elsewhere in the hospital;\n\u2022\nBe responsible for the provision of information, advice and\nsupport for all patients and their carers throughout the course of\nthe illness; this should include those who are receiving most of\ntheir care from clinicians who are not members of the urological\ncancer team, such as physicians for care of the elderly;\n\u2022\nProvide treatment and follow-up for these patients and ensure\nthat every patient with urological cancer receives\nmultidisciplinary management with appropriate oncological\ninput; \n\u2022\nProvide a rapid referral service for patients who require\nspecialist management;\n27\n1\n47\nThe Royal College of Pathologists\u2019 minimum datasets for specific cancers are available on\nhttp://www.rcpath.org/activities/publications.\n\u2022\nLiaise with primary care teams, specialist teams, services for the\nelderly and voluntary organisations such as hospices;\n\u2022\nEnsure that GPs are given prompt and full information about\nany changes in their patients\u2019 illness or treatment;\n\u2022\nCollect data for network-wide audit.\nThe team must maintain close contact with all other professionals\nwho are actively involved in treating or supporting patients.  These\nwill include the following:\n\u2022\nStoma nurse;\n\u2022\nLiaison psychiatrist;\n\u2022\nClinical psychologist trained in psychotherapy and cognitive\nbehaviour therapy;\n\u2022\nTrained counsellor with expertise in cancer and psychosexual\nproblems;\n\u2022\nSocial worker;\n\u2022\nOccupational therapist;\n\u2022\nGPs/primary health care teams;\n\u2022\nPalliative care teams;\n\u2022\nClinical geneticist/genetics counsellor.\nArrangements should be made to alert an appropriate member of the\ncore team whenever a patient managed by that team is admitted to\nhospital for any reason, both so that the team may contribute to\ndecision-making about diagnosis or treatment and to ensure that it\nhas up-to-date information about such patients.\nThe team should meet weekly and should assume responsibility for\nall patients with urological cancers.  All team members should attend\nthe majority of meetings and all should participate in collaborative\ndecision-making.  \nDecisions about management and standards for therapy should follow\ndocumented clinical policy which has been agreed throughout the\nnetwork.  This policy should be demonstrably evidence-based and\nshould be produced jointly by members of all the teams in the\nnetwork which deal with patients with urological cancer. \n28\n1\nOne member of the team (usually the lead clinician) should take\nmanagerial responsibility for the service as a whole.  Audit of\nprocesses and outcomes, and action stimulated by audit findings,\nshould be discussed in team meetings.  Data collection systems\nshould be compatible with those used at the cancer centre to facilitate\nnetwork-wide audit.\nSpecialist urological cancer teams\nPatients with cancers which are less common or require complex\ntreatment should be managed by specialist multidisciplinary urological\ncancer teams.  These teams should be established in large hospitals or\ncancer centres, and each team should carry out a cumulative total of\nat least 50 radical operations for prostate or bladder cancer per year.\nAll operations carried out by any particular team should be carried\nout in a single hospital, which should also provide post-operative\ncare and host the MDT meetings. \nIn larger cancer networks (those providing services for urological\nmalignancies for populations of two million or more), a second\nspecialist team may be established, provided the population served by\neach of the teams is no less than one million.  Any non-centre teams\nshould be capable of the full range of activities required of specialist\nteams and must be able to demonstrate strong clinical links to the\nradiotherapy centre and associated non-surgical oncology services at\nthe cancer centre.  \nWhere two specialist teams are established within one network, there\nshould be strong links between them.  They should jointly establish\ncommon clinical policies across the network as a whole, and for the\naudit of all aspects of their work.  Each team should appoint a lead\nclinician who will take an active role in the co-ordination of\nurological cancer services provided by the network as a whole.  \nSpecialist urological cancer teams should manage the following types\nof patient.  The figures given in brackets for each category of patients\nare the numbers likely to require complex or radical surgery each\nyear in a population of one million.  \n\u2022\nMen with early-stage prostate cancer for whom surgery is\nconsidered appropriate and who elect to undergo radical\nprostatectomy (25-50).\n\u2022\nPatients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (50).  Patients with\nhigh-risk superficial tumours should be formally discussed with\nthe specialist team; some of these will require referral for\nmanagement by the specialist team.  There should be specific\nlocal protocols which define these patients and give details of\nappropriate referral and management.\n29\n1\n\u2022\nPatients with kidney cancer who fall into the following\ncategories (20-30):\n\u2022\nThose with tumours which have, or may have, invaded\nmajor blood vessels;\n\u2022\nPatients who might benefit from resection of metastases;\n\u2022\nPatients with bilateral disease or who will require dialysis;\n\u2022\nPatients with small tumours for whom nephron-sparing\nsurgery may be possible;\n\u2022\nPatients with von Hippel-Lindau disease or hereditary\npapillary tumours. \nSupra-network specialist teams\nPatients with testicular or penile cancer should be managed by\nspecialist testicular cancer or penile cancer teams working at the\nsupra-network level.  Such teams should serve up to four networks,\nwith a combined population base of at least two million for testicular\ncancer and four million for penile cancer.  (See Topic 6,  Testicular\ncancer , and Topic 7,  Penile cancer .)  These teams should liase closely\nwith local urological cancer teams which will be responsible for some\naspects of the diagnosis and treatment of these cancers.\nMembers of specialist urological cancer teams\nThe MDT described below should be regarded as a generic form;\nadditional members are required for teams treating male genital\ncancers at the supra-network level, as specified in Topic 6,  Testicular\ncancer  and Topic 7,  Penile cancer .  Each member of a specialist\nurological cancer team should have a specialist interest in urological\ncancer and all team members must attend a majority of meetings.\nThe team should carry out a cumulative total of at least 50 radical\noperations for prostate or bladder cancer per year.  \nThe specialist urological cancer team should include one or more of\neach of the following individuals:\n\u2022\nUrologists.  There should be at least two urologists in the team.  \n\u2022\nClinical oncologist.\n\u2022\nMedical oncologist, except where the clinical oncologist has\nspecific expertise in systemic treatment for urological cancers. \n\u2022\nRadiologist with expertise in urological cancers.  All imaging\ninvestigations should be carried out in accordance with Royal\nCollege of Radiologists Guidelines.\n46\n30\n1\n\u2022\nPathologist.  Pathology reports should include all the information\nrequired by the current Royal College of Pathologists\u2019 minimum\ndataset for the relevant cancer.\n47\nThe pathologist should participate\nin a national histopathology quality assurance (EQA) scheme.\n\u2022\nClinical nurse specialist.  This role is similar to that of a breast\ncare nurse.  The nurse must have a high level of skill in\ncommunication because patient advocacy and provision of\ninformation and support for patients and carers are crucial\naspects of the role. (See Topic 3,  Patient-centred care .)  \n\u2022\nPain management and palliative care specialist(s).  Some\npalliative care specialists may be nurses but consultant input and\nadvice will be necessary.\n\u2022\nTeam co-ordinator, who will organise meetings and ensure that\nall documentation (such as patient lists and case notes) that may\nbe required to inform discussion is available at each meeting. \n\u2022\nTeam secretary, who should provide clerical support for the\nMDT, record decisions, and communicate information generated\nby the MDT to all those who may require it.\nThe team should have access to critical care facilities.  It should\nmaintain close contact with other professionals who may be actively\ninvolved in supporting patients or carrying out the management\nstrategy decided by the team, so that rapid access to their services can\nbe provided when required.  These include the following:\n\u2022\nGPs/primary health care teams;\n\u2022\nLocal urological cancer teams at linked cancer units;\n\u2022\nPlastic surgeon;\n\u2022\nThoracic surgeon;\n\u2022\nLiaison psychiatrist;\n\u2022\nClinical psychologist trained in psychotherapy and cognitive\nbehaviour therapy;\n\u2022\nCounsellor with expertise in treating psychosexual problems;\n\u2022\nStoma care nurse;\n\u2022\nLymphoedema specialist;\n\u2022\nOccupational therapist;\n31\n1\n\u2022\nSocial worker;\n\u2022\nPalliative care teams.\nOrganisation of MDT meetings (local and specialist\nteams)\nMeetings should be arranged by the team co-ordinator, who should\nensure that information necessary for effective team functioning is\navailable at each meeting.  This will include a list of patients to be\ndiscussed and copies of their case notes, along with diagnostic,\nstaging, and pathology information.  \nPreparation and attendance at meetings should be recognised as\nclinical commitments and time should be allocated accordingly.  Team\nmembers should be adequately prepared for each meeting, so that\nthey can discuss each case without delay. \nAll new patients should be discussed, along with any other patients\nwhose cases are thought to require discussion as their condition or\ntreatment progresses.  Straightforward cases may need very little\ndiscussion but they should nevertheless be included.\nAudit, clinical trials, and other issues of relevance to the network\nshould also be discussed at MDT meetings.\nSuitable facilities should be provided to support effective and efficient\nteam working.  In addition to the basic physical facilities such as\nadequate room and table space, these are likely to include, for\nexample, appropriate equipment to allow the whole group to review\nlarge numbers of radiographic images and pathology slides.  Teams\nmay consider taking formal training to facilitate effective group\nworking.\nCo-ordination between teams\nClose co-ordination is required between primary care teams,\ndiagnostic and treatment teams at cancer units and cancer centres,\npalliative care teams, and patients and their families.  There should be\na designated individual in each team who has responsibility for\ncommunication and information provision, and adequate support must\nbe provided to ensure that all decisions about patient management are\nrecorded.  (See the role of team secretary/co-ordinator, above.) \nClearly defined arrangements should be made to ensure that\nappropriate information (including the name of the clinician and nurse\nspecialist who are directly responsible for each patient) is\ncommunicated promptly to patients and others (such as GPs) who\nmay require, or may benefit from, information about decisions\nconcerning particular patients.  GPs should be given sufficient\ninformation about each patient\u2019s cancer and management for them to\nadvise and support patients and their carers.  \n32\n1\nTrusts should produce patient-held information packs.  These should\ncontain details of the patient\u2019s disease and treatment, relevant MDT(s),\nclinical appointments, and a diary in which patients can record\nsymptoms and other potentially useful information about their\ncondition, both for the patients\u2019 own use and to help clinicians who\nmay see them out of hours to respond appropriately to their needs.\nB. Anticipated benefits\nRe-structuring services for urological cancers to increase specialisation\nand establish multidisciplinary team working is expected to produce\nwide-ranging benefits for patients and the NHS. \nA co-ordinated cancer network should be capable of delivering\nconsistent, efficient and effective care to all patients in the region it\ncovers.  Within each level of the service, team working will facilitate\nco-ordinated care.  Patients managed by teams which function\neffectively are more likely to be offered appropriate information and\nguidance, to receive continuity of care through all stages of their\ndisease, and to be treated in accordance with locally-agreed protocols\nand clinical guidelines.  \nIncreasing specialisation will tend to refine surgical expertise, provide\nthe necessary conditions for training in uro-oncology for specialist\nregistrars and newly appointed consultants, and permit meaningful\naudit of individual outcomes.  This will enhance the level of skill\navailable within the NHS.  \nDiscussion of every patient by multidisciplinary teams will improve\npatient-centred care by ensuring that psychosocial, as well as clinical,\nissues are considered; these issues tend to be raised by nurse\nspecialists and others who bring different perspectives from those of\nurologists and oncologists.  It provides an opportunity for pathology\nand radiology results to be discussed and allows the team as a whole\nto check that everything necessary is done for the patient.  \nIt is anticipated that these changes, implemented together, will lead to\nsignificant improvements in outcomes for patients with urological\ncancers.\nC. Evidence\nNote: The reliability and quality of evidence supporting the recommendations is\ngraded A, B and C, where A is the strongest evidence.  The grading taxonomy is\nexplained in Appendix 2.\n33\n1\nMultidisciplinary teamwork\nThere is little direct research evidence for the effectiveness of\nmultidisciplinary teamwork in the management of patients with\nurological cancer.  Nevertheless, there are a number of strands of\nevidence which, considered together, point to the value of this model\nof working.\nIn prostate cancer, in particular, patients are faced with difficult\ndecisions about treatment options.  As the evidence summarised in\nTopic 5,  Prostate cancer  shows, there is often no convincing evidence\nfor the overall superiority of any particular approach to treatment over\nothers.  Uncertain benefits of treatment have to be balanced against\npotentially deleterious effects on quality of life.  In this situation,\nspecialists have a natural tendency to prefer, and to recommend, active\ntreatment using the modality in which they specialise.  Most tend to\nunder-value conservative options such as active monitoring.\nThese biases have been documented in studies of the attitudes and\nbehaviour of urologists and oncologists treating men with prostate\ncancer.(B)  They have also been reported by patients, who find the\nexperience of hearing conflicting recommendations from different\nspecialists distressing.(C) \nInsights from the Cancer Services Collaborative\nTwo case studies of action to improve the effectiveness of MDT\nmeetings discussing patients with prostate cancer have been reported\nby the Cancer Services Collaborative in England.(C)  The initial\nproblems \u2013 poor attendance by team members and failure to discuss\nall the patients who should have been discussed \u2013 were common to\nboth and were solved by similar strategies.  \nThese strategies had two main elements.  The first was improved team-\nbuilding, with involvement of all team members in discussions about\nmeetings.  The second was the introduction of effective systems to ensure\nthat all new patients were discussed and that necessary information (such\nas case notes and results of diagnostic investigations) was available for\neach patient at the meeting.  Documentation was improved using, in one\ncase, a  pro forma  developed specifically for these meetings, and in the\nother, an information sheet designed to aid communication.  \nBoth case studies reported improvements in attendance rates and the\neffectiveness of meetings.  The proportion of patients discussed by the\nteams also rose.  One study reported a dramatic increase in the\npercentage of patients managed in accordance with clinical guidelines,\nfrom 10% before the introduction of the MDT  pro forma  and action to\nensure the availability of patients\u2019 notes, to 100% eight months later.  \nFurther information can be obtained from the Cancer Services\nCollaborative Service Improvement Guide on Multidisciplinary\nteamworking at www.nhs.uk/npat.\n34\n1\nSpecialist management \nIt is rarely possible to separate the effects on outcomes of specialist\nmanagement and high patient throughput; in practice, the former is\nnot achievable without the latter \u2013 although it is conceivable that, in\nsome hospitals, large numbers of patients may be treated by relatively\nunspecialised clinicians. \nThere is consistent evidence showing the benefits of either higher\npatient throughput or higher levels of institutional specialisation in\nboth prostate and testicular cancer.  Systematic reviews and individual\nstudies which examine relationships between the number of patients\ntreated and the quality of treatment received show that care in high\nvolume institutions is associated with significantly better outcomes.(B) \nFor radical surgery for prostate cancer, the cut-off points for high and\nlow volumes vary between studies, but all show a progressive\nimprovement in outcomes from the smallest centres (25 or fewer\nprostatectomies per year) to the largest (over 140 per year).  Hospitals\nwhich manage larger numbers of these patients report lower\ncomplication and mortality rates and lower resource use.  \nIn one review of outcomes after radical prostatectomy, in-hospital\nmortality rates were almost identical in low and medium volume\nhospitals (<25 or 25-54 prostatectomies per year), and significantly\npoorer than in higher volume hospitals (>54 prostatectomies per year);\nodds ratios 1.8 and 1.7 for low and medium volumes (95% CI: 1.2 to 2.7\nand 1.2 to 2.6, respectively), compared with higher volumes.  Serious\ncomplications and re-admissions showed the same pattern: the highest\npatient numbers were associated with the lowest risk.  Compared with\nhospitals which carried out more than 140 prostatectomies per year, the\nrisk of serious complications was 43% greater (95% CI: 37% to 48%) in\nhospitals which carried out 39 or fewer prostatectomies, 25% greater\n(19% to 31%) for a volume range of 39-74, and 9% greater (3% to 15%)\nwhen volumes were between 75 and 140.  However, simply increasing\nthe throughput of patients managed by established institutions may not\nbe sufficient to improve outcomes.(B)\nIn testicular cancer, too, there is a clear relationship between patient\nnumbers treated and the quality of care provided.  Patients treated in\ninstitutions which deal with larger numbers of such cases are\nsignificantly more likely to survive.(B)  (See also Research Evidence\nfor Topic 6,  Testicular cancer .)\nFurther evidence supporting concentration of services comes from a\nreview focusing on specialisation, which reported reduced mortality\nrates among patients treated for urological cancers by specialists, or in\nhospitals linked with universities.(B)  \nStudies of pathology services in prostate and testicular cancer have\nfound that specialised centres produce more accurate reports on\n35\n1\nbiopsy specimens.  Histopathological review by experts can result in\ncrucial changes in management; for example, a study of testicular\ntumour pathology found that expert review led to a major change in\ndiagnosis in 6% of cases.(B)\nCurrent services in the NHS\nNHS services for the more common forms of urological cancer are\nfragmented, with most hospitals treating small numbers of these\npatients.  Hospital episode statistics (HES) show that about two-thirds\nof the hospitals which carry out prostatectomy, and over three-\nquarters of those which carry out cystectomy, do 10 or fewer of each\noperation per year.  Table 10 and Figure 2, below, show frequency\ndistributions of Trust workload for radical surgery for prostate and\nbladder cancer in England between 1995 and 2000.\nTable 10. Frequency distribution of Trust workload for\nprostatectomy and cystectomy combined (England)\n* \n* \u201cOperations\u201d refers to the combined total of radical prostatectomies and\ncystectomies carried out for cancer treatment by individual Trusts in a specified year.\n36\n1\nNumber of\n1995/96\n1996/97\n1997/98\n1998/99\n1999/00\noperations \nper Trust*\n0-4\n53\n37\n38\n32\n25\n5-9\n55\n55\n42\n34\n29\n10-14\n23\n24\n26\n27\n24\n15-19\n10\n9\n16\n21\n25\n20-24\n5\n10\n13\n16\n14\n25-29\n3\n10\n9\n11\n8\n30-34\n2\n4\n4\n6\n8\n35-39\n2\n2\n3\n5\n7\n40-44\n3\n3\n5\n45-49\n1\n50-54\n1\n1\n1\n55-59\n1\n1\n60-64\n65-69\n1\nGrand Total\n154\n154\n153\n156\n148\nWhilst it is clear that workload patterns are changing in the direction\nof higher volumes and, presumably, greater specialisation, there is a\nlong way to go before the criteria recommended in this Manual can\nbe met.  Just two hospitals in England provided 50 or more radical\noperations (prostatectomies plus cystectomies) for prostate or bladder\ncancer in 1999-2000, 7.4% of the total number done (2,358\noperations).\nFigure 2. Frequency distribution of Trust workload for\nprostatectomy and cystectomy combined (England)\nAlthough HES data provides a fair picture of the general situation in\nthe NHS, HES figures are not precisely correct.  The accuracy of HES\ndata depends on the quality of coding, both for disease and\nprocedure, and errors occur when patients with cancer are not\nidentified or the nature of surgery is incorrectly described.  In\naddition, recent Trust mergers mean that data for more than one\ntreating hospital may be included in a single figure, overstating\nhospital workload.  Despite these limitations in the data, there is no\nreason to doubt the overall picture of low rates of radical urological\nsurgery in individual NHS hospitals.\nD.

Resource implications\nAt the time of writing, there are few genuine MDTs in urological\ncancer.  Implementing these recommendations will require far-\nreaching changes in working practices and establishment of new staff\nposts within the team.  For example, a larger number of clinical nurse\nspecialists and team co-ordinators will be required than are currently\nin post, and time has to be set aside by all those involved to attend\nteam meetings.  Increased resources will be required over a\nconsiderable period for re-structuring of urological services, for\ntraining, and to achieve sufficient numbers of professionals to work in\nthese teams.\n\u2022\nThe additional annual costs of ensuring that all MDTs have a co-\nordinator, an additional consultant session, and additional staff\ntime for MDT meetings are estimated at \u00a36.4 million (see\nAppendix 1,  Economic implications of the guidance ).\n\u2022\nThe cost consequences of the centralisation of radical surgery\nfor bladder and prostate cancers to teams in specialist centres is\nbetween \u00a33.8 and \u00a35.0 million (see Appendix 1,  Economic\nimplications of the guidance ).\n39\n1\nDiagnosis and\nassessment\nThe following guidelines for urgent referral (within two weeks) have\nbeen published by the Department of Health:\n48\nSimilar guidelines for\npatients at high risk of urological cancer have been published in\nWales.\n49\n\u2022\nMacroscopic haematuria in adults.\n\u2022\nMicroscopic haematuria in adults over 50 years.\n\u2022\nSwellings in the body of the testis.\n\u2022\nPalpable renal masses.\n\u2022\nSolid renal masses found on imaging.\n\u2022\nElevated age-specific prostate specific antigen (PSA) in men with\na 10 year life expectancy.\n\u2022\nA high PSA (>20ng/ml) in men with a clinically malignant\nprostate or bone pain.\n\u2022\nAny suspected penile cancer.\nA. Recommendations\nDiagnostic investigations in primary care\nGPs within each network should work with members of specialist\nurological cancer teams to develop and circulate locally agreed\nguidelines on appropriate referral for patients with suspected\nurological cancer.  Compliance with these guidelines should be\naudited. \n40\n2\n48\nDepartment of Health.  Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer.  Available on\nhttp://www.doh.gov.uk/cancer. \n49\nNational Assembly for Wales.   Urological Cancer Services All Wales Minimum Standards.\nAvailable on http://www.wales.gov.uk/subihealth/content/cscg/index.htm \nProstate cancer\nGPs should use digital rectal examination (DRE) to assess lower\nurinary tract symptoms (such as frequency, hesitation, poor stream)\nsuggesting obstructive disease of the prostate or bladder neck.  If the\nprostate feels normal, the option of PSA testing may be discussed with\npatients but appropriate counselling, including information about the\nreliability of PSA results and acknowledgement of uncertainty about\nthe balance of risks and benefits, should be given before a PSA test is\ncarried out.  Patients should be offered material designed to promote\ninformed choice about PSA tests, available through the National\nelectronic Library for Prostate Cancer.\n14\nAny patient with a prostate\nthat feels abnormal, or whose symptoms or test results suggest the\npossibility of prostate cancer, should be referred to a prostate\nassessment clinic (see below). \nTesticular cancer\nOnly a small proportion of men with scrotal swellings have cancer; a\nGP may see only one case of testicular cancer every 20 years and is\nnot likely, therefore, to be able to distinguish between tumours and\nnon-malignant causes of symptoms.  GPs should refer men with\ntesticular masses or other unexplained testicular symptoms such as a\nsensation of scrotal heaviness or pain, to a testicular assessment clinic\n(see below).\nPenile cancer\nGPs should refer men with suspicious penile lesions such as growths,\nswelling at or near the glans, painless ulcers which do not appear to\nbe due to infection, or other unexplained abnormalities such as\nplaques on the skin or foreskin of the penis, to a local urological\ncancer team. \nBladder and kidney cancer\nMost patients with bladder or kidney cancer develop visible haematuria\nand they should be referred within two weeks to a dedicated\nhaematuria clinic.  Patients with kidney cancer may also present with\npersistent loin pain; such patients should be referred for imaging.  \nPatients (particularly those over 50 years of age) with persistent\nirritative urinary symptoms which do not respond to antibiotic\ntreatment should be referred for further investigation. \nDiagnostic services in district general hospitals\nProstate assessment clinics and haematuria clinics should be provided\nby urology departments of district general hospitals.  These clinics\nshould be staffed by diagnostic teams with members drawn from the\nlocal urological cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT), and should\ninclude a nurse with special responsibility for providing information\nand support for patients.  Urologists and other clinic staff should give\npatients clear reasons for investigations and explain the implications\nof results.  (See Topic 3,  Patient-centred care .) \n41\n2\nDiagnostic services should be organised, where possible, so that they\ncan carry out sufficient tests to determine whether cancer is present\nduring a single visit.  The concept of a one-stop clinic should not be\ntaken to imply that all diagnostic tests should be offered in a single\nlocation or necessarily carried out at the first visit.  Ultrasonography,\nfor example, may be carried out in a radiology department but the\nMDT should aim to synchronise imaging with other diagnostic\ninvestigations so that delays are minimised.\n50\nWhen successive appointments are necessary, they should be pre-\nbooked to minimise delay between investigations.  An appointment to\ndiscuss results should be arranged for a date within two weeks of the\ninitial investigation appointment.  Patients should be encouraged to\nbring a close friend or relative to any meeting at which they are\nexpected to receive news of a diagnosis of cancer. \nProstate assessment clinics should provide DRE and PSA testing, as\nwell as trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) and needle biopsy, carried out\nby a suitably trained health professional. \nHaematuria clinics should offer clinical examination, urine testing,\nflexible cystoscopy, and rapid access to ultrasound imaging and\nintravenous urography (IVU) when required.  When an abnormality\nor growth in the bladder is apparent but the diagnosis is uncertain,\npatients should be told that a definite diagnosis cannot be given until\npathology results are available.  \nArrangements also need to be made for rapid assessment of scrotal\nswellings using ultrasound; this service may be provided as part of\ngeneral urology or elsewhere, as judged appropriate locally.  All\ndiagnostic and assessment services should follow documented clinical\npolicies which have been agreed throughout the network.\nStaff who carry out diagnostic investigations such as biopsy should\nhave received adequate and appropriate training in the techniques\nthey use, to minimise the potentially high error rate.  When prostate\nbiopsy proves negative but there is strong suspicion that cancer is\npresent (for example when the PSA level remains persistently high),\nre-biopsy is necessary.  Local clinical protocols should include specific\ncriteria to guide judgements in such cases.\n42\n2\n50\nAn appropriate model might be the one-stop clinic for diagnosis of breast cancer.\nMammography is often carried out in a different part of the hospital from the breast clinic,\nbut diagnostic investigations are integrated so that patients do not have to wait for long\nperiods.\nDiagnostic investigations in secondary and tertiary\ncentres\nProstate cancer\nTRUS and prostate biopsy may be carried out by a suitably trained\nhealth professional working in a prostate assessment clinic.\nPathology reports should include all the information required by the\ncurrent Royal College of Pathologists\u2019 minimum dataset for prostate\ncancer.\n51\nWhen biopsy samples suggest the presence of cancer and\nradical treatment is being considered, pathology results should be\nreviewed by the pathologist member of the specialist urological\ncancer team at the centre at which such treatment would be carried\nout.  A national histopathology quality assurance (EQA) scheme\nshould be established along the lines of the EQA scheme for breast\ncancer, to be run by those directly involved in this work.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may have a role in the pre-\noperative assessment of patients who are considered to be at\nintermediate or high risk (PSA above 10ng/ml, Gleason score 5 or\nmore), who might benefit from radical treatment and whose cancer\ndoes not appear to have spread beyond the prostate.  All images\nheld by local MDTs should be forwarded to the appropriate specialist\nMDT if radical surgery is being considered.\nNetworks should agree and document clinical policies for the use of\nbone scans in urological cancers.  Routine bone scanning is not\nnecessary for all patients with prostate cancer.  In particular, it is not\nlikely to be useful for previously untreated men with PSA levels\nbelow 10ng/ml and Gleason scores below 8, who are free from bone\npain.  Such men are very unlikely to have metastatic disease.\nTesticular cancer\nTesticular cancer can be reliably confirmed or excluded by a\ncombination of clinical examination and ultrasound imaging.  Men\nwith scrotal swellings should be assessed in regular clinics equipped\nwith ultrasound facilities capable of producing precise images and\nstaff who are skilled in interpreting ultrasound images of the\nscrotum.  \nIf ultrasound and clinical examination suggest the presence of cancer,\nblood should be taken before surgery to assess levels of tumour\nmarkers including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), lactate dehydrogenase\n(LDH) and beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (\n\u03b2\nhCG).  The results\nof these assays should be available within one week.  Laboratory\ntechniques for measuring these tumour markers should be agreed by\nthe whole network, to ensure consistency across the network.\n43\n2\n51\nThe Royal College of Pathologists.  Minimum dataset for prostate cancer histopathology\nreports.   Available on http://www.rcpath.org/activities/publications/prostate.html.\nMost patients should undergo orchidectomy before referral to a\nspecialist testicular cancer MDT at a designated cancer centre, except\nwhen there are clear signs or symptoms of metastatic germ cell\ncancer.  These patients should be referred immediately to the\nspecialist MDT.  \nThe risk of cancer in the contralateral testis and the option of biopsy\nshould be discussed with patients.  Biopsy and surgical samples\nshould be reviewed by a histopathologist member of the testicular\ncancer MDT.\nBladder and other urothelial cancers\nThe majority of patients will be assessed in haematuria clinics,\ndescribed earlier in this section.  Assessment of bladder cancer\nnormally requires diagnostic resection.  If initial assessment suggests\nthat the patient has a low-grade superficial tumour, resection can be\ncarried out by a urologist member of the local urological cancer MDT\nwho has an interest in bladder cancer.  This resection should be\nsufficiently deep to determine the depth of tumour invasion.\nPathology reports should include all the information required by the\ncurrent Royal College of Pathologists\u2019 minimum dataset for bladder\ncancer.\n52\nAbout 50% of patients will have high-risk superficial tumours or\nmuscle-invasive cancer (T2 or above).  Patients with G2 or G3\ntumours should be formally discussed with the specialist urological\ncancer team.  Those who have pT2 or more advanced tumours\nshould be referred to the specialist team; images produced at local\nhospital or unit level should be sent with the patient for review by\nthe specialist team.  MRI, or computed tomography (CT) if MRI is not\navailable, should be used to assess the extent of invasive tumours\nbefore radical treatment.  Patients with high-risk tumours should have\nthe opportunity to discuss the implications of the results of staging\ninvestigations in a joint meeting with a surgeon and an oncologist.\nTumours of the upper urological tract are relatively unusual.  These\ntumours are linked with bladder cancer and the same grading system\nis used.  Assessment and staging requires urinary cytology,\nureteroscopic biopsy, and CT imaging.\nKidney cancer\nThe diagnosis of kidney cancer is usually made by imaging.  All\npatients with renal masses which could be malignant should be\nreferred to the local urological cancer team.  \n44\n2\n52\nThe Royal College of Pathologists.  Minimum dataset for bladder cancer histopathology\nreports.  Available on http://www.rcpath.org/activities/publications/bladder.html.\nCT is required to assess local invasion and spread to lymph nodes.\nThe lungs should be scanned using CT to check for metastatic\ndisease, except in patients with small tumours (up to 3cm), for whom\nchest x-ray may be sufficient.  If it appears that tumour may have\ninvaded the renal vein or inferior vena cava, or if nephron-sparing\nsurgery might be possible, patients should be referred to the specialist\nurological cancer team, which should arrange further assessment\nincluding MRI.  Biopsy is not normally necessary before surgery; it\nshould be reserved for selected cases when imaging is unclear or\nsurgery is not appropriate and biological treatment is being\nconsidered.  \nB. Anticipated benefits\nThe establishment of dedicated clinics for the assessment of\nhaematuria and prostate-related symptoms is expected to reduce\ndelays in diagnosis of the more common forms of urological cancer.\nCurrently, many patients with urological cancers experience long\ndelays before a definitive diagnosis is achieved and treatment begins.\nIt is unclear whether such delays affect survival rates, but they can\ncause considerable distress to patients.  \nThe Cancer Services Collaborative in England has demonstrated that a\nprostate assessment clinic with a pre-booked appointments system\ncan reduce delays from as much as six months to less than one\nmonth.  When diagnostic services are not only efficient, but sensitive\nand responsive to patients\u2019 needs, this tends to establish a pattern of\nharmonious relationships between patients, carers and service\nproviders.  \nAccurate staging and pathology results are essential to inform\ndecision-making about therapy. \nC. Evidence\nNote: The reliability and quality of evidence supporting the recommendations is\ngraded A, B and C, where A is the strongest evidence.  The grading taxonomy is\nexplained in Appendix 2.\nProstate cancer \nDetection and initial diagnosis\nProstate cancer may produce no symptoms until it has reached an\nadvanced stage, but early cancer can be detected by DRE, which is\nused to investigate lower urinary tract symptoms.  In older men, these\nsymptoms are often caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia, with\nwhich cancer may co-exist.   \n45\n2\nDRE is quick and minimally invasive and when negative, usually\nmeans the patient does not have prostate cancer (negative predictive\nvalue 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98 to 0.99).  The positive predictive value of\nDRE is low in the context of primary care (0.28, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.36),\nso a positive result cannot be used to make a diagnosis but does\nindicate a need for further investigation and/or referral.(B)\nThe most-studied diagnostic test for prostate cancer is the PSA assay.\nPSA rises with the burden of disease and is generally highest \u2013 often\nover 100ng/ml \u2013 in men with metastatic disease.  Prospective\nscreening studies have found that a quarter to a third of men with\nPSA over 10ng/ml have prostate cancer but PSA levels vary widely,\nboth among men who do have cancer and those who do not.  There\nis no criterion below which men may be reassured that they do not\nhave cancer, nor an agreed level which is regarded as diagnostic.\nDifferent systems for measuring PSA can produce quite variable\nresults and apparent changes in PSA levels can reflect the use of\nassay materials from different manufacturers.  In addition, sexual\nactivity, clinical investigation and some forms of treatment can affect\nPSA levels.(B)\nTRUS is used to estimate prostate size, guide needle biopsy and stage\ntumours.  Biopsy is necessary for histological confirmation of cancer,\nbut this too can produce very variable results, depending on operator\nskill and the method used.  Re-biopsy can be positive for cancer in a\nsubstantial proportion of cases when initial biopsy was negative but\nother investigations suggest the presence of cancer. Adverse effects of\nprostate biopsy include pain, bleeding and infection; they have been\nreported to occur in up to 13.5% of patients who receive antibiotic\ncover and up to 34% of those who do not.(B)\nAssessment of stage and local spread\nInformation on the stage and spread of prostate cancer can be\nobtained from PSA, DRE, TRUS, CT and MRI, and accurate assessment\nrequires an appropriate combination of these.  Clinical assessment of\nearly prostate cancer tends to underestimate the stage of the tumour,\noften failing to detect when tumour has spread beyond the capsule of\nthe prostate.  In a recent study, 13% (17 of 131) of men who were\nbelieved on the basis of clinical assessment (including DRE) to have\norgan-confined disease, actually had bone metastases. \nAccurate imaging is essential to assess the extent of apparently\nlocalised prostate cancer if radical treatment is being considered,\nbecause surgery is not likely to be curative when the tumour has\nspread beyond the capsule.  Ultrasound, although invaluable for\nguiding biopsy, is not adequate for informing decisions of this sort\nexcept in low-risk patients.\n46\n2\nTwo studies suggest that that MRI is more useful than CT for assessing\nextracapsular extension and invasion of seminal vesicles and lymph\nnodes.(B)  However, these were poor quality studies and imaging\ntechnology has improved since they were carried out.  MRI is\nhowever, recommended as the staging method of choice for prostate\ncancer by the Royal College of Radiologists.\n53\n(C)\nMetastatic disease\nIn the UK, about 20% of men have metastatic disease, usually affecting\nthe bones, when their prostate cancer is first diagnosed.  PSA level is\nthe best biochemical marker for bone metastases, which are very rare\nin untreated men with PSA below 10ng/ml.(B)  Only a minority of\nmen with PSA levels between 10 and 50ng/ml have metastatic disease,\nand efforts have been made to find a criterion which offers the\noptimum compromise between sensitivity and specificity.  Levels of 35\nand 70ng/ml have been proposed on the basis of receiver operator\ncharacteristic (ROC) curves.(B)\nBone pain in men with prostate cancer is usually due to metastatic\ndisease.  In one study, all patients with bone pain and PSA levels over\n20ng/ml had metastatic disease.(B)  A US review of 288 patients who\nwere classified as \u201cat risk\u201d of bone metastases if they had abnormal\nacid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase or bone pain found that only\n1.4% of men who had none of these had metastases (B).  Poor overall\nfunctioning is also associated with metastatic disease.(B)  \nBone scans are generally used as the \u201cgold standard\u201d to detect bone\nmetastases but it is not clear from the research evidence that these, on\ntheir own, are actually more accurate than the combination of\nsymptoms and appropriate blood tests.  Bone scans are appropriate,\nhowever, for assessing men with bone pain, since they can be used to\ninform management.\nTesticular cancer\nInitial diagnosis\nNo review of research evidence was carried out to assess the\neffectiveness of ultrasound for the initial diagnosis of testicular cancer.\nThere is consensus in the clinical community that this is the most\nappropriate form of investigation.(C)\nAssessment of metastatic disease\nCT is generally more accurate than plain film chest radiography (x-ray)\nfor detection of lung metastases.  The use of both chest radiography\nand CT is not justified.(B)\n47\n2\n53\nHusband JE, Johnson RJ, Reznek RH.  A guide to the practical use of MRI in oncology.\nLondon: The Royal College of Radiologists, 1999.\nBladder and kidney cancers\nDetection and initial diagnosis\nMost patients with cancers of the bladder or kidney present with\nvisible haematuria.  This may be intermittent but a single episode of\nhaematuria can signal the presence of cancer.  Clinic-based studies\nsuggest that 15% to 37% of patients with visible haematuria may have\ncancer, with higher proportions in areas where substantial numbers of\npeople work in hazardous industries (see  Background ).(B)\nMicroscopic haematuria is common in young men and is rarely\nassociated with any pathology, but it is a better predictor of cancer in\nolder men.  A large study (n=1,930) based in a Newcastle hospital\nhaematuria clinic found that 9.4% of patients with microscopic\nhaematuria had cancer.  Although the probability of cancer increased\nwith age, it was found in a few men below the age of 40.(B) \nBladder and kidney cancers are unusual in people less than 40 years\nold.  The incidence of both rises steeply with each decade between\nthe ages of 40 and 60, rising from 9.2 per 100,000 in men aged 40-44\nto 36.5 per 100,000 in men aged 50-54, and 109.5 in those aged 60-\n64.  The incidence in women shows a similar rate of increase with\nage, but the proportion affected in each age-group is less than half\nthe corresponding proportion of men.(B) \nAssessment of tumour stage and spread \nThe Royal College of Radiologists states that \u201cMRI is superior to CT\nfor staging bladder cancer\u201d and recommends that MRI should be the\nstaging method of choice.\n54\n(C)  Published comparative studies do not\nshow a consistent advantage for MRI over CT but these studies are all\nrather old and the technology has improved.(B)  In renal cell cancer,\nCT is adequate for assessing most tumours but MRI may be\nmarginally more accurate for staging.(B)  \nQuality of current services\nA study of the management of muscle-invasive bladder cancer in the\nSouth West Region in 1989 and 1993 revealed clear evidence of\ndeficiencies.  The median delay between GP referral and diagnostic\ncystoscopy was 59 days in 1989 and 52 days in 1993; there were then\nfurther delays of 55 days (1989) and 44 days (1993) between\ncystoscopy and treatment.  This brings the total period for median\ndelay to more than three months in both 1989 and 1993.\nInadequacies were reported in diagnosis and staging, with poor\nrecording of details of pathology and stage of tumours.  Similar\nproblems were found in all types of hospital.(B) \n48\n2\n54\nHusband JE, Johnson RJ, Reznek RH.  A guide to the practical use of MRI in oncology.\nLondon: The Royal College of Radiologists, 1999 ,  p 46.\nMore recent data shows that waiting times may be long in England as\na whole.  Median time before the first out-patient appointment for\nNHS patients newly diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1997 was 20\ndays for urgent cases, 33 days for those classified as non-urgent; time\nto first definitive treatment was 57 and 82 days for these groups,\nrespectively.  10% of urgent patients had to wait four months or more\nbefore their treatment began.(B)\nThe situation is even worse for patients with prostate cancer.  An\naudit of delays experienced by patients with localised prostate cancer\nin south west England in 1993 found that some men waited for more\nthan a year after their first clinic appointment before treatment began.\nThis study also reported serious deficiencies in assessment, staging,\ndocumentation, and communication between the various clinicians\ninvolved in patient care.(B)  The study described in the previous\nparagraph found that for England as a whole, waiting times were\nlonger for men with prostate cancer than for patients with any other\ncommon cancer.(B)\nThe Cancer Services Collaborative in England has reported on pilot\nstudies of a variety of initiatives designed to reduce delays in\ndiagnostic services for prostate cancer.(C)  These studies provide\ninformation both on the situation that existed before the initiative was\nlaunched (November 1999), and on ways of streamlining services to\nimprove the experience for patients. \nThe Collaborative found that the established pattern in the NHS was\nfor diagnostic investigations to be undertaken in sequence, with each\nsuccessive investigation arranged only when the results from the\nprevious one became available.  This creates built-in delays.  The\nintroduction of rapid-access and one-stop clinics, along with pre-\nbooking systems for diagnostic appointments, led to impressive\nreductions in delay.  Examples of successful initiatives in diagnostic\nservices include the following:\n\u2022\nIn Leicester General Hospital, waiting time from referral to\ndiagnosis was cut from 36 weeks to 3-4 weeks by the\nestablishment of a prostate assessment clinic.  \n\u2022\nOne-stop clinics in three Trusts in the Bristol area now allow\npatients to have counselling, examination and appropriate\ninvestigations on a single day, with a follow-up appointment for\nresults 10 days later.  \n\u2022\nIn Liverpool, a wait of 6-18 weeks for a staging bone scan was\nreduced to two weeks for appropriate patients by the\nintroduction of protocols.  \n49\n2\n\u2022\nIn Colchester, patients had to wait for up to three months before\ngetting their prostate biopsy results.  The delay was reduced to a\nmaximum of two weeks by re-organising the appointments\nsystem.\n\u2022\nPatients in West London waited eight weeks for TRUS and\nbiopsy, and a further two weeks to hear the results.  Now,\nbiopsy is done either the same day as the first consultant\nappointment or within a week, and it is pre-scheduled.  The\ntotal delay has been reduced from 10 weeks to two or less. \nFurther information is given in the Prostate Cancer Service\nImprovement Guide, available from the Cancer Services Collaborative\n(www.nhs.uk/npat).\nD.

Resource implications\nThe direct resource implications specific to the recommendations in\nthis topic are modest.\n\u2022\nThey include \u00a30.28 million for bladder cancer and between\n\u00a30.23 million and \u00a30.4 million for pre-operative MRI imaging for\nprostate cancer.  These are offset by savings of \u00a30.34 million to\n\u00a30.58 million for bone scans (see Appendix 1,  Economic\nimplications of the guidance ).\n\u2022\nHowever, the rising incidence of prostate cancer coupled with\ngreater use of PSA testing will increase both diagnostic and\ntreatment costs (see Topic 5,  Prostate cancer ) .\n51\n2\nPatient-centred care\nA. Recommendations\nThe recommendations in this section call for major changes in the\nprovision of care for patients with urological cancers.  Nurse specialists\nwill play a crucial part, both in ensuring that patients receive adequate\nsupport and information, and in shaping the way that urological\ncancer multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) work.  These aspects of the\nnurse specialist\u2019s role, although relatively new to urology, are\nparticularly well developed in services for patients with breast cancer.\nCommunication with patients \nIn urological cancer in general, and prostate cancer in particular, the\nappropriate management strategy for an individual patient may\ndepend crucially on that individual\u2019s values and attitudes.  Because of\nthe nature of the disease and the unpredictable rate of progression,\nthe optimum strategy is often unclear.  Radical treatment carries the\nthreat of incontinence and permanent damage to sexual function and\nenjoyment, which may be unacceptable to some patients \u2013 especially\nwhen there is uncertainty about the degree of survival benefit that\nsuch treatment may offer.  Others may feel that such risks are of little\nsignificance compared with the prospect of living with cancer.  \nIn this situation, shared decision-making is essential.  This can only\nwork if patients are sufficiently well informed to understand the choices\nthey face, and have sufficient time to consider the options carefully.  \nPatients should be given as much information as they wish to have,\nin language they are likely to understand, and in both verbal and\nwritten forms.  When English is not the patient\u2019s first language,\nsomebody who speaks the patient\u2019s language should be available to\nfacilitate communication.  Providers should not expect members of\nthe patient\u2019s family to act as interpreters.\nPatients should be given written material in information packs (see\nTopic 1,  The urological cancer network and multidisciplinary teams )\nto which additional material can be added as required.  Each pack\nshould contain up-to-date information about the patient\u2019s disease and\ntreatment, the names of MDT members responsible for his or her\ncare, and clear information about services, including the following:\n\u2022\nA description of the way the clinics and doctors function\ntogether, and their various responsibilities. \n52\n3\n\u2022\nThe way the appointments system operates. \n\u2022\nContact details for people with whom patients or carers can talk\nif they feel concerned about any aspect of the illness, its\ntreatment, or the hospital service.  \n\u2022\nA telephone number for the nurse specialist member of the\nMDT responsible for his or her care.\nInformation offered to patients should also include:\n\u2022\nSufficient information about basic anatomy and pathology for\npatients and their carers to understand how the disease might\naffect them.\n\u2022\nRealistic information about the disease and the range of\nindividual variation in its impact and rate of progression.  \n\u2022\nInformation about known causes of the patient\u2019s type of cancer,\nincluding occupational risk factors if relevant.\n\u2022\nThe aims, risks and likely effects of proposed diagnostic\nprocedures.  Each procedure should be explained to the patient\nbefore it is undertaken.  \n\u2022\nBalanced information about potential treatment options,\nincluding the probability of improved survival or symptom\nreduction (and uncertainties about benefits), known risks and\npotential short- and long-term adverse effects.  \n\u2022\nThe likelihood of long-term continuing contact with the\nurological cancer team.\n\u2022\nReasons for not offering interventions which patients might\nanticipate.  \n\u2022\nInformation on action that patients can take to help themselves\nand sources of support for such action \u2013 e.g. quitting smoking,\nimproving their diet.\nPatients should receive individual support and guidance from\nmembers of the MDT, as well as well-produced information leaflets.\nWhen patients have a choice between different therapeutic modalities,\nthey should be offered the opportunity to discuss treatment options in\na joint meeting with their urologist, oncologist, and specialist nurse.\nProviders should ask patients if they want additional information and\nseek to discover how much they wish to be involved in discussions\nabout treatment.  Patients should be encouraged to bring a close\nfriend or relative to the \u201cbad news\u201d consultation.  \n53\n3\nClinicians must be sensitive to potential problems with communication,\nand those who provide direct patient care \u2013 particularly senior clinical\nstaff - should have training in communication skills.  They need to be\naware that patients often find it difficult to take in information given\nduring the consultation, especially just after receiving bad news.\nSensitive communication of bad news is particularly important to\npatients.  The \u201cbad news\u201d consultation should be carried out in a\nprivate room without interruptions.  The diagnosis should be\nexplained clearly by a senior clinician who must allow adequate time\nfor explanation and a specialist nurse should be present.  After the\nconsultation, the specialist nurse should offer to remain with the\npatient to provide support and further information tailored to\nindividual needs.  The Mount Vernon guidelines on handling the\ncommunication of bad news\n56\nshould be followed.\nAll health professionals involved with each patient should know what\ninformation has been given to the patient.  A record of this, along with\nthe patient\u2019s preferences for information and involvement in decision-\nmaking, should be included in the notes and given to the patient\u2019s GP,\ntogether with a comprehensive summary of the management plan, as\nquickly as possible, so that primary care staff can provide additional\nsupport for patients and carers. \nAdvice for smokers\nPatients with bladder or kidney cancer should be asked if they smoke\nand smokers should be strongly advised to quit.  The association\nbetween smoking and urological cancer should be explained, and the\nbenefits of quitting explicitly linked with reduced risk of recurrence.\nSmokers should be given information about local initiatives designed\nto help them quit and encouraged to participate.\nPsychological support, sexual issues, continence and\nfertility\nFrom the time of diagnosis, each patient should have access to a\nspecialist cancer nurse who can offer psychosocial support and continuity\nof care.  Patients should, whenever possible, be offered contact details\nfor others who have experienced similar cancers or treatments; this may\nbe arranged through Patient Advocacy and Liaison Services (PALS).\nAppropriate patients should be given information about organisations\nwhich offer specific forms of support such as The Association to Aid the\nSexual and Personal Relationships of People with a Disability (SPOD)\n57\n.\nThe nurse specialist, or another member of each MDT, should be\ntrained in counselling patients and couples who may have to live with\nimpotence or other sexual problems, loss of fertility, incontinence or\n54\n3\n56\nThe Mount Vernon guidelines and a Patient Information Card can be obtained from the\nKing\u2019s Fund by ringing 020 7307 2672.

Psychological and psychosexual\nissues should be discussed with every patient who may experience\nadverse effects in these areas before final decisions are made about\ntreatment.  Counselling should be available when required from an\nindividual who has specific expertise in dealing with psychosexual\nand body-image issues; this should be available to help patients and\ntheir partners to cope with such problems after treatment and for as\nlong as it is needed.\nPatients who may have problems with urinary incontinence should be\ngiven information both about local continence services and the\nContinence Foundation.\n58\nArrangements for cryopreservation of sperm should be explained to\nmen whose ability to father children could be reduced by treatment .\nThis is likely to be particularly relevant to men with testicular cancer.  \nPractical and social support\nMany patients, particularly those with prostate cancer, are over 70\nyears of age.  They, and their carers, are likely to require long-term\nsupport.  The primary and palliative care teams have particularly\nimportant roles in co-ordinating with social services and ensuring that\nthe needs of both patients and carers are identified and met.\nPatients should be given information about sources of help, such as\nlocal and national support groups and disability and benefits\nhelplines, both verbally and in writing.  Information about support\ngroups of various kinds is provided by NHS Direct and by cancer\ncharities.\n59\nB. Anticipated benefits\nProvision of clear and timely information can help patients to cope\nwith their disease, enhance satisfaction with services, and reduce\ncriticism and complaints.  Sensitive delivery of bad news is particularly\nvalued by patients.  \nInformation has a variety of benefits for cancer patients, particularly\nanxiety reduction, improved ability to cope with treatment and better\nself-care.  Effective communication tends to heighten awareness of the\nvarious needs - whether medical, practical or psychological - of patients\nand carers, and increase the probability that these needs can be met.\n55\n3\n58\nInformation about the Continence Foundation can be found on \nwww.continence-\nfoundation.org.uk\n.  The Foundation provides a helpline on 020 7831 9831.\n59 \nWebsites which provide information on support groups for cancer patients and carers can\nbe obtained from NHS Direct (Tel: 0845 4647)\nC. Evidence\nNote: The reliability and quality of evidence supporting the recommendations is\ngraded A, B and C, where A is the strongest evidence.  The grading taxonomy is\nexplained in Appendix 2.\nCommunication and information\nInsights from patients treated for urological cancer \nPatient focus groups, convened to discuss services for urological\ncancers, emphasised the importance for decision-making of good\ninformation on adverse effects of treatment and long-term quality of\nlife.  The communication of bad news was specifically highlighted;\nthe nature of this experience seems to influence patients\u2019 views about\nsubsequent interactions with health services.  In particular, patients\nvalue the following: \n\u2022\nPrivacy and lack of interruption during the \u201cbad news\u201d\ninterview; \n\u2022\nDiagnosis given by a senior clinician; \n\u2022\nClarity; patients prefer clinicians to use the word \u201ccancer\u201d, thus\navoiding confusion when they explain the diagnosis;\n\u2022\nAppropriate timing and adequate time for explanation;\n\u2022\nSensitive mode of communication; \n\u2022\nImmediate support and information after the interview, tailored\nto individual needs and provided by a specialist nurse.\nPatients reported problems with inadequate information during and\nafter treatment.  Lack of information left them bewildered, fearful, and\nunable to cope with long-term adverse effects of treatment such as\nincontinence.  Some reported conflicting information from different\nclinicians and a specific lack of information about brachytherapy,\nabout which they learnt from the internet.  They wanted more\nsupport in decision-making about treatment options and more\ninformation about known adverse effects of treatment.\nWhilst patients did not expect clinicians to be able to predict the\nfuture \u2013 especially in metastatic disease \u2013 they did want to know\nwhat might happen to them, and what support services were\navailable.  In particular, they wanted advice and support to help\nprepare for whatever the future might hold.  Contact with other\npatients who had undergone similar experiences was valued.\n56\n3\nResearch evidence \nThe review of research evidence did not identify any studies which\nspecifically addressed communication and information needs of\npatients with urological cancers.  The following conclusions have\nbeen drawn from studies which included patients with a variety of\ncancers.\nProblems with communication between clinical staff and patients can\ncause unintended distress.  Although some patients may not wish to\ntake an active part in decision-making, there is consistent evidence\nthat they value accurate information and that many feel they are not\ngiven sufficient information.  Studies demonstrating both patients\u2019\ndesire for information and its beneficial effects are summarised in the\nResearch Evidence for previous documents in this series, in particular\nImproving Outcomes in Lung Cancer.\nThe following strategies have been found to be effective for\nimproving communication: \n\u2022\nDoctors asking patients directly, in a structured way, whether\nthey would like to know about particular issues.(A)\n\u2022\nProviding patients with a questionnaire (using the word \u201cillness\u201d,\nnot \u201ccancer\u201d), to elicit their concerns.(A)\n\u2022\nA taped or written record of the consultation.  Although a\nmajority of patients find audiotapes helpful, they can increase\ndistress in those whose prognosis is poor and some patients do\nnot wish to receive them.  It is important that staff check that\nthe patient does want a record of the consultation before it is\ngiven.(A)  \n\u2022\nPatient-held shared-care records or information folders which\nhold details of appointments, medication, strategies for symptom\ncontrol, contact addresses and telephone numbers, and a diary\nof significant events.(B)\n\u2022\nProvision of specific, easily-understood information about the\nnature and effects of any treatment before it begins, and on the\nmanagement of pain and other symptoms at home.  Such\ninformation can reduce anxiety and lead to more effective\nsymptom control and self-care.(A)\n\u2022\nCancer information booklets, videos, tapes and telephone help-\nlines.  Whether these provide specific information, for example\non pain management or anti-cancer treatments, or more general\ninformation on cancer, they are appreciated by patients and\ncarers alike.(A)\n57\n3\nTraining in communication skills can change the attitudes of health\nprofessionals, improve their methods of eliciting and offering\ninformation, and increase their confidence in their ability to deal with\npatients with cancer.(B)  The benefits appear to be greatest for people\nwho hold particularly negative attitudes before training.(B)  Some\nstudies suggest that improvements can be maintained for several\nyears, but training which fails to address participants\u2019 concerns may\nnot be effective, as the skills learnt will not be put into practice.(B)  \nPsychosocial interventions\nCancer has profound effects on the lives of patients and their families,\ntouching them at every level.  They may need psychotherapeutic help\nor social support at any point, from initial diagnosis to death and\nbereavement.  Estimates of the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in\npatients with advanced cancer range from 37% to 63%.(B)\nThe research evidence is consistent in showing that social support\nand psychotherapeutic or psycho-educational interventions can\nimprove patients\u2019 quality of life.  A wide range of psychological\ninterventions can reduce anxiety, depression, nausea, vomiting and\npain;(A) cognitive therapy designed specifically for patients with\ncancer is significantly more effective than supportive counselling.(A)\nHome support by an oncology nurse during periods of out-patient\ntreatment may reduce anxiety and depression.(A)  \nOne small study (n=73) of patients with newly diagnosed testicular\ncancer found that routine cognitive/behavioural treatment was\nineffective for this group.(A)  Such interventions may be more\nappropriate for patients who are experiencing difficulty in coping with\ntheir situation.  \nD. Measurement\nStructure\n\u2022\nEvidence that patients are given appropriate and adequate verbal\nand written information about their cancer, proposed treatments\nand options, and sources of practical help.\n\u2022\nTraining courses in communication skills for clinical and other\nstaff. \n\u2022\nClinical nurse specialists who have had training in counselling\npatients with cancer. \n\u2022\nFacilities and support for patients\u2019 mutual support groups.\n58\n3\nProcess\n\u2022\nPrivate rooms used for crucial meetings between health care\nstaff and patients (in particular, consultations at which patients\nare given bad news).\n\u2022\nThere should be evidence that patients receive information and\nsupport from the time of diagnosis from suitably trained staff.\n\u2022\nThere should be evidence that every patient has access to a\nnamed nurse specialist who knows about his or her condition\nand who can offer advice and arrange meetings with\nappropriate health or social services staff when required.\n\u2022\nThe proportion of staff involved in direct patient care who have\nhad specific training in communication and counselling skills\nshould be monitored.\nOutcome\n\u2022\nProviders should carry out surveys of patients\u2019 experience to\nassess the adequacy of each component of patient-centred care,\nincluding patient knowledge about available resources and\npatients\u2019 views on the quantity of information and the manner in\nwhich it was given.\nE. Resource implications\n\u2022\nAdditional resources may be necessary for the provision of\ninformation and educational material for patients with urological\ncancers.  \n\u2022\nResources will be required to allow sufficient staff time for\nprovision of help and support for patients.\n\u2022\nAdequate training in communication skills and psychosexual\ncounselling for nurses and other clinical staff is likely to require\nadditional resources.\n\u2022\nExpansion in the numbers of specialist nurses is recommended.\nThese staff have a range of roles including patient support and\nimproving communications.  The overall cost of expanding\nnumbers of specialist nurses is \u00a32.68 million (see Appendix 1,\nEconomic implications of the guidance ).\n59\n3\nPalliative care\nSupportive and palliative care guidance is currently being developed\nunder the auspices of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence\n(NICE).  This section deals with the structure of palliative care\nservices.  Interventions for palliation of symptoms associated with\nadvanced urological cancer are discussed in the context of specific\ncancers, in particular prostate cancer.\nA. Recommendations\nPalliative care should be an integral part of patient management.\nSpecialist palliative care teams should be available to arrange the\nprovision both of relief from symptoms and social and psychological\nsupport for patients and their carers when these needs cannot be met\nby primary care teams.\nPatients with advanced urological cancer may require care from\nspecialist cancer treatment teams, specialist palliative care teams and\nprimary care teams.  Palliative care teams should work closely with\nprimary care teams and hospital services; rapid and effective\ncommunication and information-sharing between teams is essential.\nSpecific services should be established for patients with advanced\nurological cancers.  The majority of these will be men with prostate\ncancer, who may live with slowly progressing disease for a decade or\neven more, but there will also be men and women with other forms\nof advanced urological cancer.  All need care that evolves to fit their\nchanging requirements.  These services should be linked with other\nprimary and palliative care services.\nCriteria for referral for specialist care should be agreed and\ndocumented for the whole network by palliative care specialists and\nrepresentatives from primary care and specialist treatment teams.\nPrimary care teams should assess patients\u2019 needs regularly and\naccurately, to ensure that patients who require specialist palliative\ncare or interventions (see below) are referred quickly and\nappropriately. \n60\n4\nThe specialist palliative care team\nPalliative care is essentially a local service, and specialist palliative\ncare teams should be based both in hospitals that manage patients\nwith urological cancer, and in the community.  The role of the\nspecialist palliative care team includes both direct care for patients\nand families with complex problems, and the provision of advice,\nsupport and education for other health professionals.  One member\nof the team should be responsible for ensuring co-ordination of\npalliative care services and rapid communication, both between\nprofessionals and with patients and their families. \nThe specialist palliative care team should be multidisciplinary, and\nshould, as a minimum, include the following members:\n\u2022\nPalliative care physician.\n\u2022\nPalliative care nurse specialists.\nThe team should have close links with the following:\n\u2022\nPhysiotherapist.\n\u2022\nClinical psychologist.\n\u2022\nLiaison psychiatrist.\n\u2022\nSocial worker.\n\u2022\nOccupational therapist.\n\u2022\nChaplain/pastoral care worker who can offer counselling and\nspiritual guidance for patients with advanced incurable illness\nand their carers.\n\u2022\nBereavement care worker.\n\u2022\nThe primary care team.\nPatients, their carers, GPs and hospital staff who care for these\npatients should have access to a member of the specialist palliative\ncare team at any time of the day or night.  A named member of the\nteam should be responsible for ensuring effective co-ordination of\npalliative care services, continuity of care, and rapid communication,\nboth between professionals and with patients and their families.  \nThe team should endeavour to make it possible for patients to spend\ntheir remaining life in the place they prefer, whether this is home,\nhospital or hospice, but should be alert to the possibility that this\npreference may change as death approaches.\n61\n4\nManagement of patients with advanced disease \nAll patients with advanced cancer should be asked regularly if they\nhave pain, so that prompt action may be taken to relieve it.  Cancer\npain can normally be controlled with oral or parenteral analgesics,\nusually opiates, in accordance with the World Health Organisation\n(WHO) 3-step method for control of cancer pain.\n60\nThis requires\nregular and frequent assessment of pain, with titration of the dose of\nanalgesia against pain severity.  \nThere should be a system for rapid referral for radiotherapy for\npalliation of pain, particularly when it is associated with bone\nmetastases.  Urgent access to radiotherapy, orthopaedic and\nneurosurgical services should be available for patients at risk of\nfractures or spinal cord compression.  (See Topic 5 , Prostate cancer. )\nB. Anticipated benefits\nPrompt identification and appropriate action to manage problems\nexperienced by patients is crucial to reduce their distress and\ndisability and diminish strain on carers.  High quality co-ordinated\npalliative care services can improve quality of life for people with\nadvanced cancer, and effective home care can usually keep symptoms\nsufficiently well controlled to allow patients to stay at home for as\nlong as they wish.  This is preferred by most patients and may be the\nleast expensive option for the NHS.\nC. Evidence\nNote: The reliability and quality of evidence supporting the recommendations is\ngraded A, B and C, where A is the strongest evidence.  The grading taxonomy is\nexplained in Appendix 2.\nPatients\u2019 needs\nAdvanced urological cancer and its treatment can cause pain, fatigue,\nmobility problems, fractures, constipation, urinary retention or\nincontinence, impotence, psychological distress and problems with\nsocial relationships.  Palliative care and support must be multi-faceted\nand responsive to the needs of individual patients; conventional care\nalone is not sufficient.\nPatients with advanced disease can receive high quality care in a\nvariety of settings, including hospitals, hospices, and their own\nhomes, so long as there is adequate input from specialists who can\noffer pain and symptom control when required.  Older primary\n62\n4\n60\nWorld Health Organisation.  Cancer Pain Relief.  Geneva: World Health Organisation, 1996.\nstudies showed poorer management of pain for patients in their\nhomes than in the institutional environment, but this appears to have\nimproved in recent years.(B)\nPalliative home care teams have small but positive effects on\noutcomes for both patients and carers.  Pain, symptom control and\nlevels of satisfaction can be improved by specialist home care team\ninvolvement.(B)  \nA systematic review of studies which compared \u201cstandard home care\u201d\nwith interventions based in hospitals, hospices or the community,\nsuggests that standard care alone may not be sufficient.  Additional\ninterventions may be required for patients who remain at home, to\ncontrol physical symptoms and reduce the need for re-admission.\nFavourable results were reported in studies of palliative home care\nteams when members held regular meetings and visited patients at\nhome.(B)  \nCurrent NHS services \nThe Department of Health undertook a national stocktake of palliative\ncare services across England in 1999.  The results of this survey,\nmapped in collaboration with the Office of National Statistics, is\navailable on the Department of Health cancer website\n(www.doh.gov.uk/cancer).  For all categories of provision \u2013 day care,\nhome care, hospice and specialist palliative in-patient care, and\nhospital support \u2013 a majority of health authorities in every region\nreported shortages.  Only 14 of 99 health authorities were able to\nreport adequate provision of all types of service.\nD. Measurement\nStructure\n\u2022\nDocumented local clinical policies to guide referral for palliative\ncare.\n\u2022\nEvidence that appropriate palliative care services are available in\nhospitals, hospices and the community, and that their resource\nand staff levels are adequate.\n\u2022\nAppropriate facilities for rehabilitation and palliative care.\n\u2022\nSpecialist palliative care teams which meet specifications given\nin the NHS  Manual of Cancer Service Standards  in England, and\nthe Minimum Standards for Specialist Palliative Care as applied\nto Cancer Services in Wales.\n\u2022\nSystems to permit 24-hour access to specialist advice on\npalliative care.\n63\n4\n\u2022\nArrangements to facilitate prompt access to specialist\ninterventions, including specialist pain control.\n\u2022\nAvailability of rapid access to radiotherapy and orthopaedic\nservices. \n\u2022\nEvidence of effective communication systems for information-\nsharing between all levels of the service and all those involved\nin individual patient management.\nProcess\n\u2022\nAudit of home visits made by palliative care team members.\n\u2022\nEvidence of regular meetings of palliative care teams.\n\u2022\nAudit of time to provision of specialist palliative interventions. \n\u2022\nAudit of speed of provision and appropriateness of equipment\nsupplied by occupational therapists to patients in the\ncommunity.\nOutcome\n\u2022\nAudit of symptom control.\n\u2022\nProportion of patients who suffer bone fractures or spinal cord\ncompression.\nE. Resource implications\nImproved co-ordination of care could reduce costs per patient, but\nimproving access to specialist palliative care services is likely to\nrequire increased resources in many areas.  These changes are not\nspecific to patients with any particular type of cancer.\n64\n4\nProstate cancer\nProfound changes are anticipated in services for prostate cancer and it is\nrecognised that, for many Trusts, establishing the structures described in\nthis Manual will be a gradual process.  Full implementation of the\nrecommendations below may only be possible when other components\nof the service, in particular the multidisciplinary team (MDT) structure,\nhave been set up.  These recommendations, therefore, describe services\ntowards which networks should work.\nA. Recommendations\nEarly (organ-confined) prostate cancer \nThe prostate cancer service should be capable of providing active\nmonitoring, radical surgery, radiotherapy, or hormone treatment for\nmen whose cancer is believed to be confined to the prostate.  All\npossible management options should be discussed with patients. \nThere is no consensus on the optimum form of management for these\npatients.  Although observational studies suggest that radical treatment\ncan improve long term survival rates in particular patient groups, this\nevidence is by its nature subject to bias.  In addition, the uncertain\nbenefits of radical interventions must be balanced against the risk of\nlasting adverse effects.  Research \u2013 both randomised controlled trials\nand audit of outcomes outside the context of clinical trials \u2013 is\nessential to clarify the role of each form of treatment and should be\nsupported.  \nDifferent men vary greatly in the value they ascribe to potential\noutcomes.  The treatment each patient receives should be tailored to\nfit his individual values and situation, so it is essential that patients are\nactively involved in decision-making.  This requires that they receive\nadequate and accurate information, both through meetings with\nmembers of the MDT, and in published forms that they can study at\nhome.  Patients should be given sufficient time to consider all the\noptions available to them. (See Topic 3 , Patient-centred care. )\nActive monitoring\nActive monitoring aims to detect disease progression as early as\npossible.  This allows intervention to be avoided when the patient\u2019s\ncondition is stable, whilst permitting prompt action to control symptoms\nand reduce the risk of serious problems when the cancer is progressing.  \n65\n5\nThe option of active monitoring should be discussed with all men\nwhose tumours are believed to be confined to the prostate.  This form\nof management is particularly suitable for those who, because of\nadvanced age or poor general health, have a life expectation of less\nthan 10 years.  Monitoring should involve regular clinical review and\nassessment of the prostate using prostate specific antigen (PSA) and\ndigital rectal examination (DRE).  When symptoms or rising PSA levels\nsuggest that the cancer is progressing, the case should be reviewed by\nthe MDT and treatment options again discussed with the patient.\nPatients who are considering active monitoring should be encouraged\nto participate in EORTC trial 30991, which is randomly allocating men\nwith early prostate cancer to hormone therapy or \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d.\nThis strategy requires well co-ordinated shared care involving\nurological services, palliative care, and primary care teams.  Patients\nshould be managed in accordance with protocols which should be\nagreed by all relevant MDTs in the network and disseminated to all\nthose who are likely to be responsible for their care.  \nHormone therapy\nThe possibility of hormone treatment \u2013 orchidectomy (surgical\ncastration) or treatment with an anti-androgen or Luteinising hormone-\nreleasing hormone (LHRH) agonist \u2013 should be discussed with these\npatients.  \nSurgery\nRadical prostatectomy should be discussed with men whose tumours\nare confined to the prostate and who would be expected to live for\nmore than 10 years if they did not have prostate cancer.\nPatients for whom surgery is being considered should be treated by\nspecialist multidisciplinary urological cancer teams, normally based at\ncancer centres.  (See Topic 1,  The urological cancer network and\nmultidisciplinary teams. )  Ideally, all radical prostatectomies\nundertaken in each network should be carried out by a single team.\nRadical prostatectomy should not be carried out by teams which carry\nout fewer than 50 radical operations (prostatectomies and\ncystectomies) for prostate or bladder cancers per year.  \nThis level of work-load is currently unusual in the UK and a transition\nperiod is likely to be required for re-organisation of services before\nthe criterion of 50 operations can be met.  In the meantime, surgeons\nwho currently carry out fewer than five radical prostatectomies per\nyear should refer patients to designated surgeons who will become\nmore specialised in this type of surgery.\nLaparoscopic prostatectomy is not recommended outside the context\nof well-designed clinical trials supervised by experienced surgeons.\nProficiency in this procedure requires considerable practice and\ninexperienced surgeons can cause serious harm.\n66\n5\nRadiotherapy\nThe option of radiotherapy (external beam or brachytherapy) should\nalso be discussed with men with early disease.  Conformal\nradiotherapy, using multileaf collimators which allow treatment using\nan irregularly shaped beam, is the optimum mode of delivery and all\ncentres should aim to provide this form of treatment.  Radiotherapy\nshould be given by specialist clinical oncologists from, or in, the\ncentre.  Outcomes, including adverse effects, should be carefully\nmonitored. \nAs with other forms of radical treatment for prostate cancer, the place\nof brachytherapy is uncertain.  However, it offers the advantages of\nspeed and convenience and there is demand from some patients for\nthis form of treatment.  Centres which offer brachytherapy should\nevaluate their outcomes with particular care.  A large scale, nationally\nor internationally co-ordinated, research project is necessary to assess\nthe effectiveness of brachytherapy for localised prostate cancer.  A\nrandomised intergroup trial comparing brachytherapy with radical\nsurgery is being organised by the National Cancer Institute of Canada\nand the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (NCIC CTG\nStudy PR.10/ACOSOG Z0070).  This will evaluate the advantages\n(equivalent disease control with reduced morbidity) in patients with\nlocalised disease (T1c or T2a N0 M0), claimed by enthusiasts for\nbrachytherapy.  UK participation in this study should be strongly\nencouraged through the appropriate National Cancer Research Institute\n(NCRI) Clinical Studies Groups and clinical research networks.\nContinuing care \nThere should be documented clinical policies for shared care for men\nwith prostate cancer managed in the community. These policies\nshould specify criteria for referral back to the local urological cancer\nteam.  Telephone follow-up by the specialist nurse in the urological\ncancer team who is familiar with the patient\u2019s case should be offered\nto appropriate patients. \nPrimary care teams, patients and carers should have access to the\nspecialist nurse, who should provide telephone advice and arrange\nrapid referral to the treatment team when required. \nLocally advanced disease\nHormone therapy, with or without external beam radiotherapy,\nshould be discussed with men whose tumours extend beyond the\nconfines of the prostate.  Suitable patients should be encouraged to\nenter the MRC PRO7 trial of hormone treatment with or without\nradiotherapy. \n67\n5\nMetastatic disease\nHormone therapy\nMen with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer should be offered\norchidectomy (surgical castration) or treatment with an anti-androgen\nor LHRH agonist.  All these options should be discussed with patients,\nwho should be encouraged to make a choice based on their personal\nvalues and the likely balance of benefits and adverse effects.\nHormone treatment should not be deferred if there is a risk of spinal\ncord compression.  Maximum androgen blockade is not normally\nrecommended.\nPatients with metastatic disease in remission should remain under\ncareful observation so that treatment can be provided promptly when\nfurther symptoms develop.\nTreatment for bone metastases\nFor some patients with prostate cancer, bone pain is the first symptom.\nShort courses of radiotherapy should be available for patients with\nbone metastases.  Treatment with radioisotopes should be considered\nfor men with bone pain at multiple sites.  There is growing evidence\nthat bisphosphonates may be beneficial for men with prostate cancer\nbut no definite recommendations can yet be made.\nSevere backache should be regarded as a warning of possible spinal\ncord compression.  Patients should be informed about this risk and\nabout the importance of contacting the MDT if they experience new\nor worsening backache.  There should be systems to permit rapid\naccess to diagnosis and treatment for patients who could be at risk of\nfracture or spinal cord compression.  \nOther palliative interventions\nChemotherapy should be considered for men with symptomatic\nhormone-refractory prostate cancer and trials of this form of therapy\nshould be supported.  Palliative radiotherapy should also be available.  \nB. Anticipated benefits\nAppropriate management of prostate cancer should maximise patients\u2019\nquality of life and may improve their life expectancy.  Well-designed\nresearch studies and better routine monitoring of outcomes will help\nto provide the information necessary to judge which forms of\ntreatment are most suitable for individual patients. \nConcentration of services for patients with early tumours in the hands\nof highly-skilled specialists is likely to increase the probability of\nappropriate treatment and decrease the frequency and severity of\n68\n5\nadverse effects.  Wider use of conformal radiotherapy will permit\nbetter disease control with lower levels of adverse effects among men\nwho undergo radiotherapy.\nImproved access to treatment for metastatic prostate cancer is likely to\nreduce both patients\u2019 suffering and the burden on the health service\nof catastrophic fractures and spinal cord compression.\nC. Evidence\nNote: The reliability and quality of evidence supporting the recommendations is\ngraded A, B and C, where A is the strongest evidence.  The grading taxonomy is\nexplained in Appendix 2.\nEarly prostate cancer\nRadical interventions compared with active monitoring\nRadical treatment \u2013 prostatectomy or radiotherapy \u2013 can control local\nsymptoms of prostate cancer but can also cause significant\ncomplications, particularly impotence, proctitis and incontinence.\nThere is no reliable evidence showing whether or not it improves\nsurvival.  Large-scale prospective randomised trials are essential to\nresolve uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of different forms\nof treatment. \nA new trial, ProtecT, has been set up by the Health Technology\nAssessment programme to compare outcomes in men with screen-\ndetected prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy, radical\nprostatectomy or active monitoring.  This is expected to produce\nimportant data and should be supported.  As its starting point, the\nProtecT trial assumes absolute equipoise between active monitoring,\nradical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy, for all patients\nirrespective of age or tumour grade.   \nOther RCTs comparing active monitoring with radical treatment are in\nprogress outside the UK, but these will not produce useful data on\nsurvival rates for some years.\nMany non-randomised studies suggest that prostate cancer-specific\nsurvival rates are higher among men who undergo radical\nprostatectomy, but a variety of sources of bias \u2013 all of which tend to\nexaggerate the possible survival benefit associated with surgery \u2013 have\nbeen identified.  First, there is selection bias: the fittest men tend to\nbe selected for surgery.  Second, studies have generally been analysed\naccording to treatment received rather than intention to treat;\nconsequently, the benefits of radical prostatectomy have been over-\nestimated.  Finally, there is evidence of bias in reporting cause of\ndeath, such that deaths among patients who have undergone radical\ntreatment for prostate cancer are significantly more likely to be\n69\n5\nascribed to other forms of cancer than would be expected in this\npopulation.(B)  This would create the illusion of improved prostate\ncancer-specific survival rates even if radical treatment had no effect at\nall.\nA US population-based study using information on almost 60,000 men\nin the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database\nhas assessed the effects of different management strategies on\nsurvival.  Although this is weak evidence, it is the best currently\navailable.  Outcomes were sub-divided by tumour grade, which is the\nmost important predictor of progression in prostate cancer.  Overall,\nthe risk of dying from prostate cancer was 10 times higher among\nmen with high-grade tumours (Gleason score 8-10) than those with\nlow-grade tumours (Gleason score 2-4).(B)  This pattern is consistent\nwith results reported in other studies.\nThe effectiveness of radical treatment varied with tumour grade.\nThere was no difference in the 10-year prostate cancer-specific\nsurvivals for men with low-grade tumours, whether they elected to\nundergo radical prostatectomy or were managed conservatively.\nHowever, for men with high-grade tumours, survival rates were higher\namong those in the radical surgery group.  Outcomes for men with\nintermediate grade tumours fell roughly mid-way between these\nextremes.  Survival benefits were also reported for radical\nradiotherapy, but only among men with higher-grade tumours, and\nthe effect diminished after five years.(B)  \nThese results are only suggestive, not conclusive.  They are not\nderived from randomised data and there are potential sources of bias.\nFor example, the treatment given to patients who relapsed is not\nrecorded: many probably had radiotherapy; and prostate cancer-\nspecific death rates may not be reliable (see above).  In addition,\nthere was no adjustment for co-morbidity.  Higher levels of co-\nmorbidity would be expected in the conservative management group.\nFinally, there have been improvements in radiotherapy techniques,\nwhich may produce better outcomes in men who receive this form of\ntreatment today.\nComparisons between radical treatment modalities: adverse\neffects\nStudies of the impact of radical treatment on urinary and sexual\nfunction are consistent in reporting that surgery is more likely to lead\nto incontinence and/or impotence than radiotherapy.(B)  Men who\nundergo surgery are less likely to be incontinent or impotent before\ntreatment than those treated by radiotherapy, but are significantly\nmore likely to become so afterwards.  Bowel problems (proctitis) are\ncommon after external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), but are less severe\nwith conformal radiotherapy than older methods of delivery.(A) \n70\n5\nSurgery\nReported peri-operative mortality rates for radical prostatectomy range\nfrom 0.2% to 1.2%.(B)  Reported rates for other adverse effects vary\nwidely, but in general, they are considerably lower in case-series than\nin population studies. \nA study of 1,291 men identified from the SEER registry revealed that\nonly 32% of men had total urinary control (compared with 78% at\nbaseline) and 44% were impotent (baseline 5%) two years after\nradical prostatectomy.(B)  Much better results have been reported by\nexpert surgeons, but it must be acknowledged that the patients\nincluded in such series may be carefully selected.  Neither figures\nfrom case-series nor data derived from clinical trials can be regarded\nas realistic guides to outcomes in wider clinical practice.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy for localised prostate cancer can be delivered either by\nimplantation of radioactive seeds (brachytherapy) or external beam.\nThere is growing evidence that higher radiotherapy doses lead to\nbetter progression-free survival rates than lower doses, although the\nimpact on overall survival is as yet unknown.(A)  Two randomised\nstudies have shown that conformal radiotherapy is associated with\nlower treatment morbidity than conventional radiotherapy; higher\ndoses of radiotherapy can only be given when conformal\nradiotherapy is used.\nBrachytherapy causes similar complications to external beam\ntreatment and although adverse effects are believed to be less\ncommon, there have been no randomised trials to confirm this.\nRecent reports suggesting excellent outcomes are based on case-series\nand as such, may be seriously biased.\nA US study of treatment given under Medicare two to three years after\nbrachytherapy suggests that urinary obstruction was fairly common;\n8.3% of the 2,124 men identified received surgery (usually trans-\nurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)) for bladder outlet\nobstruction.(B)  Current techniques deliver lower doses of radiation to\nthe urethra so this problem may occur less often; however, reliable\ninformation on outcomes is not available.  The risk of incontinence\nassociated with brachytherapy depends on previous surgery: TURP\nincreases the incontinence rate from 1% to 12.5%,(B) and previous\nTURP is now regarded as a contra-indication to brachytherapy; but it\nis not clear whether brachytherapy increases the risk of incontinence\nif TURP is carried out subsequently.  Reported impotence rates vary\nfrom zero to 38% and increase with time after treatment.(B)  \nHormone therapy \nThe rate of progression of prostate cancer depends, in part, on the\nlevel of male hormones (androgens).  This is the rationale for\ntreatment with hormone manipulation using drugs, surgery\n71\n5\n(orchidectomy), or both.  Table 11 shows the main methods used, with\nthe names of the drugs of each type available in the UK.  There have\nbeen several meta-analyses of RCTs of different methods of\nmanipulating androgen levels; these are consistent in showing that no\nform of medical treatment is more effective for disease control than\norchidectomy.(A)  \nTable 11. Methods and agents used for hormone manipulation\nin prostate cancer\nHormone therapy begun immediately after diagnosis of locally\nadvanced disease significantly reduces the rate of tumour progression\nand delays the onset of metastatic disease.(A)  Hormone treatment can\nimprove local disease control when used in combination with surgery\nwhen the cancer has invaded lymph nodes.(A)  There is also\naccumulating evidence that adjuvant or neo-adjuvant hormone therapy,\ngiven with radiotherapy, can delay the progression of locally advanced\ndisease.  Some studies have reported survival benefits, but these may\nonly be significant in specific sub-sets of patients.(A)  It is not clear\nwhether hormone therapy alone might be as effective as hormone\ntreatment plus radiotherapy. \n72\n5\nMethod Drug \nnames\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nSurgical \nn/a\nLow cost in\nIrreversible; unacceptable to \ncastration \u2013 \nlong term.  \nsome men.

Treatment with an anti-androgen alone seems to have\nthe least impact on libido and is least likely to cause hot flushes.\nMono-therapy with an anti-androgen may be less effective for\ncontrolling the cancer and this type of drug can cause a variety of\nother adverse effects, particularly breast swelling and pain.(A)\nRecent meta-analyses suggest that maximum androgen blockade \u2013\ntreatment with anti-androgens in addition to surgical castration or\nandrogen suppression by pharmacological means \u2013 is unlikely to\nproduce clinically significant survival benefits.(A)  Maximum androgen\nblockade causes more severe adverse effects than monotherapy.(A) \nAdvanced disease\nRadiotherapy for locally advanced and metastatic disease\nExternal beam radiotherapy (EBRT) can help to relieve the symptoms\nof locally very advanced prostate cancer.(B)  In addition, EBRT can\nreduce pain caused by bone metastases.  Over 40% of patients\nexperience at least 50% pain relief, and just under 30% can expect\ncomplete pain relief after one month.  A single fraction is often\neffective; there appears to be little difference in efficacy between\ndifferent fractionation schedules and doses.(A)  \nStrontium-89, a radioactive isotope which is taken up preferentially by\nbone, can reduce pain in men who have multiple painful bone\nmetastases.  It is as effective as EBRT for pain relief and may be more\neffective than local field EBRT for delaying the onset of pain at new\nsites, albeit at the expense of haematological toxicity.(A)  One study\nsuggests that it may improve survival when given with chemotherapy,\nbut further research is needed to confirm this finding.  Samarium-153\nappears to offer similar benefits to Strontium-89 (A) but the two have\nnot been directly compared in an RCT.\nPalliative chemotherapy \nThe evidence on chemotherapy for men with advanced prostate\ncancer is poor, but it seems that some patients do benefit.  This issue\nis being addressed by a number of ongoing trials using a range of\nagents including taxanes.  One RCT found reduced pain scores after\nmitoxantrone/prednisolone chemotherapy in men with hormone-\n73\n5\nrefractory disease, and a second study suggested small but significant\nimprovements in time to progression, with a trend towards improved\nquality of life. \nThere is some evidence suggesting that bisphosphonates may also be\nbeneficial, but no definite conclusions can yet be drawn.\nCurrent practice in the NHS\nA survey of consultant urologists and general surgeons with an\ninterest in urology was carried out in 1996 to gather information on\nthe treatment of prostate cancer in the UK.  Despite reminders, fewer\nthan half responded, so the sample cannot be considered\nrepresentative.  Nevertheless, the findings give cause for concern for\nthree main reasons: first, they suggest that many clinicians appear to\nhold exaggerated views of the value of radical treatment and are\nunduly reluctant to recommend active monitoring (observation);\nsecond, they reveal that some clinicians were giving ineffective forms\nof treatment; and third, few respondents referred symptomatic\npatients with metastatic disease to oncologists or palliative care\nspecialists.\nRadical treatment, usually radiotherapy, was favoured by consultants\nfor the majority of patients \u2013 including those with T1 (localised)\ntumours and patients with asymptomatic disease.  Observation was\nonly the preferred option for patients aged 70 or more with well-\ndifferentiated early-stage disease.  Even in this situation, 31% of\nrespondents thought radical treatment would be more appropriate.\nTaken as a whole, this survey suggests that radical treatments are\nrecommended for many patients despite the paucity of evidence for\ntheir effectiveness or appropriateness.\nD.

Resource implications\nThe resource consequences of the recommendations for the diagnosis\nand treatment of  prostate cancer come under the Topic Areas for\nDiagnosis and assessment  and  MDTs .  In addition, and not as a result\nof this guidance, the rising numbers of prostate cancer patients are\nlikely to cost between \u00a315.4 million and \u00a343.8 million (see Appendix\n1,  Economic implications of the guidance ), depending on the scale of\nthe increase in incidence and the rate of PSA testing in the population\nat risk. \n76\n5\n77\n6\nTesticular cancer\nThere are already specialist NHS services for the management of men\nwith testicular cancer and outcomes are generally good, with 95% five-\nyear survival rates even in metastatic disease.  This is the only solid\ntumour type for which the vast majority of patients are cured.  The\nrecommendations below therefore define services which will build on,\nand improve, current practice. \nA. Recommendations\nA centralised service, described in outline in Topic 1 ( The urological\ncancer network and multidisciplinary teams ), is particularly\nappropriate for testicular cancer.  Small and medium sized cancer\nnetworks should combine to offer a specialist service for a population\nbase of two to four million.  This supra-network service, based in\nselected cancer centres, would be expected to manage around 50-100\nnew patients each year.  \nInitial diagnosis and treatment (orchidectomy) should normally be\ncarried out by a local urological cancer team; exceptions are discussed\nbelow.  A full range of testicular prostheses should be available.  All\npatients should be referred within 24 hours of surgery to designated\nspecialist testicular cancer multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) for further\nassessment, and pathology should be reviewed by the specialist\npathologist at the centre to which the patient is referred.\nAll patients should have computed tomography (CT) scans of the\nabdomen and pelvis.  A CT scan of the chest is also necessary for\npatients with teratoma.\nThe following patients should be referred immediately (before\norchidectomy) to the specialist MDT: those with obvious metastatic\ndisease and very high tumour markers, lung metastases, or germ cell\ntumours in the mediastinum, lower abdomen (retroperitoneum) or brain.  \nTreatment of early stage and locally advanced disease\nSeminoma\nAdjuvant radiotherapy to the para-aortic region is standard practice in\nmost UK centres, and should be discussed with all patients with stage\nI seminoma. \nAlternative options, such as a single cycle of chemotherapy or\nsurveillance (i.e. further treatment only if there is evidence of\nrecurrence), should not be offered unless outcomes are meticulously\nmonitored and patients receive careful counselling about the\nimportance of early detection of recurrence.\nChemotherapy should be available for patients with more advanced\ndisease, but radiotherapy may be appropriate when metastatic spread\nis confined to abdominal nodes of less than 5cm diameter. \nNon-seminomatous germ cell tumours\nAfter orchidectomy, patients with stage I malignant teratoma or mixed\nseminoma/teratoma without high risk features should normally be\nmanaged by surveillance by the specialist team, following a strict\nprotocol.  These patients should be selected after review of tumour\npathology by the specialist pathologist who deals with testicular\ntumours at the centre.  Surveillance is only appropriate if the patient\nis well motivated to return for follow-up and an effective service is\nprovided.\nAdjuvant chemotherapy, normally two courses of\nbleomycin/etoposide/cisplatin (BEP), should be discussed with\npatients when high risk features such as blood vessel or lymphatic\ninvasion are found.  However, as three cycles of BEP are usually\nadequate to treat patients who relapse, surveillance is an appropriate\noption.  The specialist testicular cancer team should review every case\nwhen treatment has been completed.\nMetastatic disease (seminoma or non-seminoma)\nChemotherapy\nMen with metastatic testicular cancer should normally receive BEP\nchemotherapy.  Those with intermediate or poor prognosis disease\nshould be encouraged to participate in large multi-centre studies\ndesigned to help define the optimum treatment for this group of\npatients. \nManagement of residual masses \nA substantial proportion of men who have undergone chemotherapy\nfor metastatic tumours will have residual masses after treatment.\nSpecialist review of radiology and pathology results is important to\nassess these masses, which may require surgical excision.  This\nsurgery should be undertaken in specialist centres where designated\nthoracic surgeons are available when needed.  About 150 patients per\nyear require highly specialised surgery, which is currently undertaken\nin at least 12 centres in England and Wales.  This should be reviewed.\nIt is doubtful whether centres which carry out fewer than 10\nprocedures per year have the necessary expertise to continue.\n78\n6\n79\n6\nSexual issues and fertility\nThe potential impact of testicular cancer on sexual function and\nfertility should be discussed with patients at the time of diagnosis.\nThe treatment team should be alert to the possibility of psychosexual\nand body image problems and allow adequate time for discussion of\nsuch issues.\nSperm storage (cryopreservation) should be offered to all patients\nwho may wish to father children.  This should be available before\nchemotherapy or radiotherapy to the contralateral testis.  \nB. Anticipated benefits\nSurvival rates are currently high and the form of service described\nhere is designed to maintain these good outcomes.  The main focus\nof ongoing research into the management of testicular cancer is to\nidentify treatment regimes that produce minimum toxicity whilst still\nachieving high cure rates.\nC. Evidence\nNote: The reliability and quality of evidence supporting the recommendations is\ngraded A, B and C, where A is the strongest evidence.  The grading taxonomy is\nexplained in Appendix 2.\nSpecialised treatment\nThere is consistent evidence that institutions that treat larger numbers\nof patients achieve better outcomes in testicular cancer (B) (see Topic\n1,  The urological cancer network and multidisciplinary teams ).  This\nsuggests that specialised management is important for all forms of this\ndisease.\nStage I seminoma\nReported cure rates for stage I seminoma are over 96%, irrespective of\nwhether patients are managed by adjuvant radiotherapy or\nsurveillance.(B)  \nAdjuvant radiotherapy \nProphylactic radiotherapy to the retroperitoneum and pelvis can be\nused to reduce the probability of relapse after orchidectomy.  This\ncan cause significant gastro-intestinal adverse effects, including pain,\ndiarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, especially when delivered to a\ndogleg field.(A)  In the longer term, patients who undergo\nradiotherapy face an increased risk of second malignancies,\ncardiovascular and renal disease.  Radiotherapy to a smaller (para-\naortic) field is less toxic than dogleg radiotherapy and just as\neffective.(A)  Treatment-related nausea and vomiting can be largely\ncontrolled with 5HT\n3\nantagonists.(A)\nEarly results of a large (n=1,600) MRC study comparing one cycle of\ncarboplatin chemotherapy with radiotherapy are expected to become\navailable in 2003.\nStage I non-seminoma\nSurveillance after orchidectomy\nAbout a quarter of patients managed by surveillance will relapse and\nrequire salvage treatment; this is normally sufficient to eliminate the\ndisease.(B) \nChemotherapy for advanced testicular cancer\n(seminoma and non-seminoma)\nPrior to the introduction of platinum-based chemotherapy in the mid\n1970s, most patients with metastatic testicular cancer died of the\ndisease.  Now, almost all are cured with combination chemotherapy\n(usually BEP), but these drugs can cause severe adverse effects.\nRecent research aimed to clarify the optimum chemotherapy regime\nand identify that which would maximise survival rates whilst\nminimising toxicity. \nThree questions have dominated recent trials.  The first was the\nnecessity for bleomycin, which, although effective, can cause serious,\nsometimes fatal, lung damage; the second was whether carboplatin is\nan effective substitute for the more toxic cisplatin; and the third\nconcerns the value of high-dose or high-intensity chemotherapy.\n1.\nHow important is bleomycin?\nAn ongoing systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs)\nhas concluded that bleomycin is beneficial despite its toxicity.  Drug\ncombinations which included bleomycin led to higher remission and\nsurvival rates than similar combinations without bleomycin\n(p<0.01).(A) \nSome other drug combinations seem to be as effective as BEP and\noffer alternative options when necessary, but no combination has yet\nbeen demonstrated to be significantly more effective.  Ifosfamide\nappears to be as effective as bleomycin but is also toxic.(A)  \n2.\nIs carboplatin an effective substitute for cisplatin?\nCarboplatin and cisplatin are different forms of platinum\nchemotherapy, but cisplatin is the more toxic of the two.  Studies\ncomparing these drugs have found that cisplatin is more effective,\nreducing both relapse and deaths due to testicular cancer.(A)\n80\n6\n81\n6\n3.\nIs more chemotherapy better?\nStudies designed to establish which regimes offer the highest survival\nrates with least toxicity have defined the most effective range of doses\nand delivery periods.  Maximising the effectiveness of chemotherapy\nrequires the use of optimum doses over the optimum time-period\n(achieving optimum dose-intensity).  Although some non-randomised\nstudies have suggested that higher doses of drugs or the addition of\nextra chemotherapeutic agents may improve outcomes, there is no\nconvincing evidence from randomised trials that high-dose\nchemotherapy is actually more effective than doses of BEP currently\nused in Europe.(A)  Maintenance chemotherapy does not improve\nsurvival, it merely increases toxicity.(A) \nSurgery for residual masses\nA study of long-term outcomes among men treated with\nchemotherapy at the Royal Marsden Hospital between 1979 and 1986\nreported that 31% of men were left with residual masses, 15% of\nwhich contained active cancer.(B)  Surgery to remove such masses\ncan lead to long-term survival, but may require complex procedures\nsuch as combined thoraco-abdominal surgery.(C)\nSexual issues and fertility\nTesticular cancer is usually diagnosed when men are in the most\nsexually active phase of their lives, when many still look forward to\nfatherhood.  Some have impaired semen quality before treatment, but\ncryopreservation of sperm before chemotherapy, radiotherapy or\nsurgery for residual masses offers the chance of fatherhood after\ntreatment.\nAround a third of men who have been treated for testicular cancer\nsuffer loss of desire or problems with sexual function.(B)  The cause\nappears to be more often psychological than physical, although\nproblems with ejaculation (\u201cdry ejaculation\u201d) are reported most\nfrequently in the research literature.(B)  \nD.

Resource implications\nNo resource implications specific to the recommendations in this\ntopic have been identified.\n82\n6\n83\n7\nPenile cancer\nA. Recommendations\nBecause penile cancer is so uncommon, its management should be\nformalised, with a degree of specialisation similar to that for testicular\ncancer.  Specialised penis cancer multidisciplinary teams (MDTs)\nshould be established jointly by two to four neighbouring networks.\nEach of these teams should serve a population base of four million or\nmore and expect to manage a minimum of 25 new patients each year.\nThe team should include members of the specialist urological cancer\nteam who work in the cancer centre within which it is based, and it\nshould also have access to expertise in plastic surgery.  \nNetworks should agree referral protocols for patients with penile\ncancer.  These should ensure that each new case is reviewed by a\nspecialist penis cancer team, and that men who are likely to require\nlymph node dissection or reconstruction of the penis are treated by\nthis team.  Other forms of treatment may be carried out by specialist\nurological cancer teams which do not specialise in penile cancer, but\nthe penis cancer MDT which reviews the case should remain\nresponsible for overall management. \nSurgery or radiotherapy may be used to treat early (stage I) penile\ncancer.  The choice of treatment should be discussed with the patient\nin a meeting that includes a surgeon, clinical oncologist and specialist\nnurse.  \nThe role of chemotherapy in the treatment of penile cancer is\ncurrently uncertain, but a trial of palliative chemotherapy should be\nconsidered for patients with metastatic disease.\nB. Anticipated benefits\nIt is anticipated that increasing specialisation in the management of\npenile cancer will enhance the probability that patients receive\nappropriate treatment.  At present, patients with early disease may be\ntreated more aggressively than necessary, whilst those with more\nadvanced disease and affected lymph nodes may not receive\nadequate treatment.  This is important because men with lymphatic\nmetastases can sometimes be cured by lymph node dissection.\nC. Evidence\nNote: The reliability and quality of evidence supporting the recommendations is\ngraded A, B and C, where A is the strongest evidence.  The grading taxonomy is\nexplained in Appendix 2.\nNo randomised trials of any aspect of the management of penile\ncancer have been identified.  All the studies in this field are\nobservational in design and most are retrospective, so the research\nevidence is weak.\nAmputation is the most common form of treatment used for penile\ncancer, but penis conserving therapy, using conservative surgery,\nradiotherapy (sometimes in combination with chemotherapy),\nbrachytherapy, or laser treatment, is used for selected patients with\nlocalised tumours.  Local failure rates may be higher than with\namputation, but prompt use of salvage therapy for recurrence seems\nto produce similar survival rates.(B)  Similarly, it is not known\nwhether prophylactic lymph node dissection or radiotherapy is better\nthan surveillance and salvage treatment for patients who develop\nrecurrence.  Randomised trials are needed to compare these ways of\ntreating penile cancer.\nThe prognosis is poor for patients with metastatic penile cancer.\nNon-randomised studies suggest that the disease may respond to\nchemotherapy but it is not clear what the optimum therapeutic regime\nor schedule might be.(B)\nD. Measurement\nStructure\n\u2022\nSystems to ensure that patients are promptly referred to a penile\ncancer MDT. \n\u2022\nEffective links between the penile cancer MDT and local MDTs\nwhich may provide treatment for these patients.\n\u2022\nAvailability of appropriate expertise in penis reconstruction.\nProcess\n\u2022\nEvidence that patients are fully informed and involved in\ndecision-making about treatment. \n\u2022\nUse of lymph node dissection in patients at high risk of lymph\nnode metastasis.\n84\n7\n85\n7\nOutcome\n\u2022\nFive-year survival rates for all patients, with information on cancer\ngrade and stage, co-morbidity, age and other features of case-mix.\n\u2022\nAudit of short-term and long-term adverse effects of treatment.\nE. Resource implications\nNo resource implications specific to the recommendations in this topic\nhave been identified.  There may be some support costs associated with\nthe formalisation of supra-network MDTs.  These have not been\ncalculated, as the numbers involved are small. \nBladder cancer\nA. Recommendations\nSuperficial tumours\nPatients with newly diagnosed, apparently superficial, tumours should\nbe treated by complete trans-urethral resection (TUR), which should\nbe carried out by designated urologists in local district general\nhospitals (DGHs).  After recovery from resection, these patients\nshould normally have a single instillation of chemotherapy (mitomycin\nor epirubicin) or glycine into the bladder (intravesical therapy).  They\nshould be allocated to one of the groups described below when the\nresults of pathological review are available. \nLower-risk superficial cancer (pTa G1 or G2 or T1, G1 or G2)\nAbout 50% of newly diagnosed patients have superficial tumours\nwhich carry a relatively low risk of progression after treatment but the\nmajority of tumours will recur locally in the bladder.  Guidelines for\nthe frequency and timing of follow-up cystoscopy should be agreed\nand adopted throughout each network. \nHigh-risk superficial cancer (pTa G3, or T1 G3 tumours,\nextensive, recurrent or multifocal G2 tumours, and carcinoma\nin situ)\nThese tumours are associated with higher risk of progression and\ndeath, and many patients are not receiving adequate treatment at\npresent.  Protocols for treatment and follow-up of patients with high-\nrisk superficial tumours should be jointly agreed by the urological\ncancer multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) of each network and adopted\nthroughout the network.  \nAlthough these patients may be treated \u2013 at least initially \u2013 by\nurologists who are members of local urological cancer teams, the\noptions should be discussed with each patient in a joint meeting\nwhich includes a urologist, an oncologist and a nurse specialist who\nare also members of the MDT.  The range of appropriate options may\ninclude intravesical treatment with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) or\nreferral to the specialist urological cancer team for possible radical\ntreatment.  If the tumour fails to respond to BCG or recurs within a\nshort time, radical treatment (normally cystectomy) should be offered.\nPatients with high-risk tumours should be encouraged, when\n86\n8\n87\n8\nappropriate, to participate in randomised trials such as the MRC BS06\ntrial comparing radical radiotherapy with intravesical therapy.\n61\nMuscle invasive tumours and locally advanced disease\nAll patients with invasive disease (pT2 and above) should be offered\na joint meeting with a surgeon, oncologist, clinical nurse specialist,\nand palliative care specialist if appropriate, to discuss treatment\noptions.  \nThere is no clear-cut evidence for the overall superiority of surgery or\nradiotherapy; although surgery appears to offer better disease control,\nit has more severe adverse effects.  There is an urgent need for a\nrandomised trial comparing these treatment modalities.\nRadical surgery\nRadical surgery (cystectomy) should be available for patients with\nmuscle-invasive tumours confined to the bladder.  Although patients\u2019\ngeneral fitness should always be taken into account when radical\ntreatment is being considered, age should not, of itself, be a bar to\nsurgery.  \nEach network should agree clear guidelines on treatment and follow-\nup of bladder cancer which ensure that cystectomy is considered for\npatients with muscle-invasive or high-risk recurrent disease.\nCystectomy is a complex operation which should be undertaken only\nby specialist surgeons working in cancer centres (see Topic 1,  The\nurological cancer network and multidisciplinary teams ).  Ideally, all\nradical cystectomies undertaken in each network should be carried\nout by a single team.  \nTeams providing this form of surgery should carry out a cumulative\ntotal of at least 50 radical operations (cystectomies or radical\nprostatectomies) for bladder or prostate cancer per year.  This level of\nwork-load is currently unusual in the UK and a transition period is\nlikely to be required for re-organisation of services before the\ncriterion of 50 operations can be met.  In the meantime, surgeons\nwho currently carry out fewer than five cystectomies per year should\nrefer patients to designated surgeons who will become more\nspecialised in this type of surgery.\nSurgical outcomes should be carefully audited and centres should aim\nto achieve 30-day mortality rates of 3.5% or less.  Suitable patients\nshould be offered bladder reconstruction or an alternative form of\nurinary diversion; facilities for reconstruction should be available\nwherever cystectomy is carried out.  \n61\nDetails available by email: bs06@ctu.mrc.ac.uk\nAdjuvant and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy\nIt is not yet clear whether adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is\nbeneficial for patients with bladder cancer.  Patients at high risk of\nprogression, such as those with tumour in lymph nodes, should be\nencouraged to participate in trials of these forms of treatment.\nChemotherapy should be initiated only by an oncologist member of\nthe specialist MDT treating the patient.\nRadical radiotherapy\nRadical radiotherapy is appropriate for patients who are not\nsufficiently fit for surgery or who wish to avoid cystectomy.  Patients\nwho have had radiotherapy but would be sufficiently fit to undergo\nsurgery should be followed up systematically and regularly so that\nsalvage cystectomy can be offered if the tumour recurs.  Neo-adjuvant\nradiotherapy \u2013 that is, lower dose radiotherapy given shortly before\nradical cystectomy \u2013 is not recommended outside the context of a\nformal clinical trial.\nMetastatic disease\nA trial of palliative chemotherapy should be considered for patients\nwith metastatic disease; chemotherapy can relieve symptoms in\npatients who respond. \nShort courses of radiotherapy should be available both for palliation\nof symptoms of advanced disease in the pelvis and for problems such\nas bone pain which may be caused by metastatic cancer.  Services for\nmanagement of bone metastases are discussed in the context of\nprostate cancer (see Topic 5,  Prostate cancer ).\nB. Anticipated benefits\nWhen these recommendations are implemented, patients with bladder\ncancer will be more likely to receive effective treatment \u2013 particularly\ncystectomy and bladder reconstruction when appropriate.  This will\nimprove both survival time and quality of life among patients with\ninvasive tumours.  \nC. Evidence\nNote: The reliability and quality of evidence supporting the recommendations is\ngraded A, B and C, where A is the strongest evidence.  The grading taxonomy is\nexplained in Appendix 2.\n88\n8\n89\n8\nSuperficial cancer\nIntravesical therapy\nThere is strong evidence from a series of meta-analyses of\nrandomised controlled trials (RCTs) that intravesical therapy (bladder\nirrigation given after trans-urethral resection) delays recurrence of\nsuperficial bladder cancer.  Intravesical chemotherapy reduces the risk\nof local recurrence by around 50% for one to two years after initial\ntreatment, and the proportion of patients who remain disease-free at\neight years is increased by 8%.(A)  \nIntravesical treatment with BCG also reduces tumour recurrence, and\nmay be more effective than intravesical mitomycin C (the\nchemotherapeutic agent used most frequently) for higher-risk\npatients.(A)  There is currently no evidence to show that intravesical\ntreatment improves long-term survival and no significant differences\nhave been found between agents in effects on disease progression or\nsurvival.(A)\nThe most common side-effect of intravesical treatment with\nchemotherapeutic agents or BCG is local inflammation in the bladder\nor urethra, leading to problems with urination such as frequency and\nurgency, haematuria and pain.  Systemic adverse effects such as \u2019flu-\nlike symptoms and fever are particularly associated with BCG and can\nbe serious.(A)\nResults from an MRC RCT suggest that post-operative treatment with\nglycine, which is not toxic, can also produce sustained benefits,\nreducing recurrence rates at five years by 6% (from 62% to 56%,\np=0.05).(A)  There have been no randomised trials comparing glycine\nwith other agents.\nFollow-up of patients treated for superficial bladder tumours\nFollow-up may involve cystoscopy and/or ultrasound imaging of the\nbladder.  There is no reliable evidence to show what the most\nappropriate follow-up strategy might be.  Small-scale observational\nstudies have reported that most recurrences occur within two years of\ninitial treatment.(B) \nAn RCT comparing two follow-up schedules for patients treated for\nsuperficial bladder cancer found no difference in clinical\noutcomes.(A)  A cost-effectiveness study reported that frequent\ncystoscopy produced no clinically meaningful advantage over less\nfrequent follow-up, and that significant financial savings could be\nmade by reducing follow-up.  It was estimated that each cystoscopy\nled to one additional day of life.\nMuscle-invasive disease \nSurgery (radical cystectomy) \nSurgeons with a special interest in uro-oncology working in NHS\nhospitals have reported peri-operative mortality rates of under 2%\nafter cystectomy.  Recent audit data from Newcastle show a post-\noperative death-rate of just 1.3% in a series of 300 consecutive\npatients who underwent cystectomy between 1999 and 2001.(B)\nThese results compare favourably with those reported by international\ncentres of excellence, but they are unlikely to be representative of\noutcomes in most NHS hospitals.  Fewer than 5% of hospitals which\nundertake cystectomy do as many in a year as Newcastle.  Few\nsurgeons, therefore, are able to develop the level of skill required to\nachieve such a low mortality rate in the context of current service\narrangements.  Although there is no clear evidence of a volume effect\nin outcomes after radical cystectomy, there is for radical prostatectomy\n(see Topic 5,  Prostate cancer , and Topic 1,  The urological cancer\nnetwork and multidisciplinary teams ), and for many other types of\nradical surgery for cancer.  \nIn a US series which included over 1,000 patients with muscle-\ninvasive bladder cancer who underwent radical cystectomy with iliac\nlymphadenectomy, the peri-operative death-rate was 3% and the\noverall survival rate was 66% at five years.(B)  Whilst these results are\nimpressive, it is likely that the patients were carefully selected.  \nStudies from the UK and elsewhere have demonstrated that there is\nno relationship between patients\u2019 age and mortality or morbidity\nassociated with cystectomy.  Co-morbidity and tumour grade, rather\nthan age, are the important predictors of outcome.(B)\nRadiotherapy\nRadical radiotherapy can lead to long-term survival in patients with\ninvasive bladder cancer.(B)  There is currently no clear evidence to\nshow whether radiotherapy is more or less effective than surgery for\npreventing disease progression and death from bladder cancer when\neither treatment modality could be used.  There is evidence\nsuggesting differences in outcome between these modalities, but some\nstudies favour surgery whilst others do not.  This could reflect wide\nvariability between centres in techniques, skilled staff, and equipment.  \nA retrospective study of patients treated in Yorkshire between 1993\nand 1996 found that, despite a 30-day death rate of 3%, three-month\nmortality rates were lower after radiotherapy (n=302) than after\nsurgery (n=96), at 1.4% versus 8.3%, respectively.  Five-year survival\nrates were similar, at 37.4% in the radiotherapy group (with or\nwithout salvage cystectomy), versus 36.5% after initial surgery.\nAnother UK study (n=120) reported an overall median survival time of\nfive years after radical radiotherapy.(B)\n90\n8\n91\n8\nIn patients whose disease has advanced beyond the bladder itself,\nsurgery may not be an option.  Radiotherapy has the advantage of\nleaving the bladder intact but can cause other adverse effects; one\nstudy of morbidity after radical radiotherapy found that 8% of patients\nhad proctitis and 4% had cystitis a year later.  The consequences of\nsurgery may be more distressing for some patients, however; a study\npublished in 1989 reported that all male patients who had undergone\ncystectomy were impotent, compared with 36% of those who had had\nradiotherapy; in addition, patients treated by surgery were more likely\nto complain of fatigue six months after treatment.(B) \nA meta-analysis of three RCTs comparing pre-operative radiotherapy\nplus radical surgery with radical radiotherapy followed by salvage\ncystectomy for recurrence, suggests that patients whose primary\ntreatment is surgery are almost twice as likely to become long-term\nsurvivors as patients treated by radical radiotherapy.(A)  Mean five-\nyear survival rates were 36% among patients treated by pre-operative\nradiotherapy and radical cystectomy and 20% in the radical\nradiotherapy/salvage cystectomy group.  Another meta-analysis, of\nfour RCTs, found that pre-operative radiotherapy followed by surgery\ndoes not improve survival, compared with surgery alone.(A)  \nThe studies in these meta-analyses involved less sophisticated\ntreatment techniques than are available today, and it is possible that\nthe findings would be different now.  A well-designed RCT\ncomparing modern surgery with modern radiotherapy (with or\nwithout neo-adjuvant chemotherapy) is badly needed.\nChemotherapy\nThe effectiveness of chemotherapy is uncertain.  Meta-analysis of\nindividual patient data from four RCTs shows no significant survival\nbenefit from neo-adjuvant or concurrent chemotherapy in\ncombination with radical surgery or radiotherapy for locally advanced\nbladder cancer.(A)  A more recent European study of neo-adjuvant\ncisplatin methotrexate vinblastine (CMV) chemotherapy also shows no\nsignificant benefit.(A)  By contrast, a recent North American study of\nmethotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin (MVAC) followed\nby cystectomy has reported significantly higher survival rates in the\nchemotherapy arm, with estimated median survival times of 6.2 years\nin the MVAC arm, compared with 3.8 years after cystectomy only: a\nhazard ratio 0.74 (95% CI: 0.55 to 0.99, p=0.027).(A) The research\nevidence on adjuvant chemotherapy is also inconclusive.\nRandomised trials are in progress and should be supported.\nAdvanced disease\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy can provide effective palliation for symptoms of locally\nadvanced or metastatic bladder cancer.  Two-thirds of symptoms were\nreported to be alleviated for a median period of nine months after\ntreatment with 35Gy in 10 fractions or 21Gy in three fractions.  These\ntwo radiotherapy schedules were equally effective.(A)\nChemotherapy\nAdvanced bladder cancer can respond to chemotherapy but\nchemotherapy has not been compared with best supportive care in a\nrandomised trial.  The combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine is\nrelatively well tolerated and appears to be as effective as the more\ntoxic regimen, MVAC;(A) however, no randomised trial has reported\nresponse rates over 65% with any drug or combination, and median\nsurvival times are generally less than one year.(A)\nTreatment in the NHS\nTreatment in the NHS is currently fragmented and it appears that the\nlevel of expertise for effective management of invasive cancers is not\navailable for the majority of patients.  Few urologists treating patients\nwith invasive bladder cancer work with oncologists.(B)  Furthermore,\nthe surgical management of bladder cancer does not appear to be\nadequate.  Figures derived from hospital episode statistics (HES) and\nBritish Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) data suggest that\nfewer than half of the patients who might benefit from cystectomy\nactually receive this operation (see Appendix 1,  Economic implications\nof the guidance ).  \nA study of the management of muscle-invasive bladder cancer in the\nSouth West Region in 1989 and 1993 revealed that 46% of patients\nreceived no definitive treatment for their tumours.  Just 12% of patients\nwith T2 tumours and 19% with T3 tumours underwent cystectomy; the\ntreatment most frequently used was radiotherapy (radical or palliative).\nSignificantly more patients with T2 tumours received no definitive\ntreatment than patients with T3 tumours, which suggests that many\nwith T2 tumours, in particular, had sub-optimal treatment.  There were\nno differences in co-morbidity between patients who received different\ntypes of treatment or no treatment at all, but their ages were\nsignificantly different: median ages of those who had primary\ncystectomy, radical radiotherapy and no definitive treatment were 64\nyears, 69 years, and 76 years, respectively.(B)\nD. Measurement\nStructure\n\u2022\nNetwork-wide protocols for treatment and monitoring of patients\nwith bladder cancer; these protocols should specify intervals for\nfollow-up cystoscopy after different stages and grades of disease.\n\u2022\nAccess to an MDT which includes surgeons with specialist\nexpertise in cystectomy and bladder reconstruction.\n92\n8\n93\n\u2022\nSystems for provision of rapid access to short courses of\npalliative radiotherapy.\nProcess\n\u2022\nEvidence that patients are informed and involved in decision-\nmaking about treatment, unless they refuse opportunities for\nsuch involvement or they suffer from such severe cognitive\nimpairment that they are unable to understand treatment\noptions. \n\u2022\nEvidence that patients with muscle-invasive or recurrent cancer\nare given even-handed advice by the MDT on radical treatment\noptions.\n\u2022\nEvidence that each surgeon responsible for cystectomy does a\nlarge enough number of these operations each year for\nmeaningful audit of individual outcomes.\n\u2022\nEvidence that the total annual number of cystectomies plus\nradical prostatectomies carried out for cancer by any team\noffering cystectomy is at least 50.\n\u2022\nMarkers of quality of radical surgery, including the proportion of\nexcised specimens with clear margins and blood transfusion\nrequirements.\n\u2022\nProportion of patients who receive each form of treatment,\nstratified by tumour stage and grade, age and co-morbidity. \n\u2022\nTime between diagnosis and initial treatment. \nOutcome\n\u2022\nAudit data demonstrating peri-operative mortality rates of <4%\nafter cystectomy. \n\u2022\nMajor surgical complication rates within three months of\noperation.\n\u2022\nFive-year survival rates for all patients, with information on\ncancer grade and stage, co-morbidity, age and other features of\ncase-mix.\n\u2022\nAudit of short-term and long-term adverse effects of treatment.\n8\nE. Resource implications\nThe estimated costs of centralisation of radical cystectomy are\ncombined with prostatectomy (see Topic 1,  The urological cancer\nnetwork and multidisciplinary teams ).\n94\n8\nKidney cancer\nThe information below is primarily concerned with renal cell cancer.\nPatients with less common forms of kidney cancer should be referred\nto specialist urological cancer teams for treatment.\nA. Recommendations\nAll patients who are sufficiently fit to undergo surgery should be\noffered radical nephrectomy (except those with small tumours \u2013 see\nbelow); this should be considered even when there is metastatic\ndisease.  Usually, nephrectomy is a relatively straightforward\nprocedure which can be safely carried out by the local urological\ncancer team.  Although surgery is normally the only treatment\nnecessary for localised tumours, oncologists should be involved in\ndiscussions about the management of all patients. \nProbably 80% of patients with kidney cancer can be managed by\nlocal cancer teams, but adequate assessment using appropriate\nimaging-computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) \u2013 is essential to identify those who should be referred for\nspecialist treatment at cancer centres.  (See Topic 2,  Diagnosis and\nassessment. )  \nPatients who should be managed by specialist urological cancer teams\nat cancer centres include the following:\n\u2022\nThose whose tumours have, or may have, invaded the renal\nvein or vena cava, or which may involve the heart;\n\u2022\nThose with limited metastatic disease which might be amenable\nto resection;\n\u2022\nThose who have bilateral disease or who will require dialysis;\n\u2022\nPatients with von Hippel-Lindau disease or hereditary papillary\ntumours.\nPatients with small tumours for whom nephron-sparing surgery may\nbe possible, should be discussed with a surgeon from a specialist\nurological multidisciplinary team (MDT).  Referral to the centre is\nlikely to be appropriate for these patients.\n95\n9\nTreatment with immunotherapeutic agents (normally interferon alpha)\nshould be available for patients with metastatic kidney cancer.  Such\ntherapy should be given by specialist oncologists with experience of\nits use, preferably in the context of a well-designed clinical trial.\nPatients should be encouraged to participate in open discussions with\nmembers of the MDT about the balance of potential harm and benefit\nassociated with different therapeutic options.\nWhen a patient has not undergone surgical resection, the nature of\nthe tumour should be confirmed by biopsy before anti-cancer therapy\nis offered.\nB. Anticipated benefits\nSurgery is usually curative in early disease, and may be curative even\nwhen there is limited metastatic disease.  Nephrectomy may also\nimprove outcomes in more widespread metastatic disease.\nImmunotherapy can increase survival time in metastatic disease and\noffers the hope of complete remission for a small minority (around\n5%) of patients.\nC. Evidence\nNote: The reliability and quality of evidence supporting the recommendations is\ngraded A, B and C, where A is the strongest evidence.   The grading taxonomy is\nexplained in Appendix 2.\nSurgery\nThere have been no randomised studies comparing partial\nnephrectomy with radical nephrectomy, but evidence from\nobservational studies suggests that some patients survive for many\nyears after partial nephrectomy without evidence of recurrent\ncancer.(B) \nRadical nephrectomy is often curative in early stage kidney cancer;\nnon-randomised studies report relapse rates of 20-30%.(B)  It also has\na palliative role, reducing symptoms, thereby presumably improving\nquality of life.  In some patients, surgical resection of a solitary\nmetastasis after radical nephrectomy can lead to long-term disease\ncontrol.(B)  Radical nephrectomy, carried out prior to treatment with\ninterferon, may improve survival even in metastatic kidney cancer;\nhowever, few patients in this situation are sufficiently fit to undergo\nmajor surgery.\n96\n9\nSystemic therapy\nKidney cancer rarely responds to chemotherapy and few patients\nbenefit from it.  Adjuvant immunological therapies such as interferon\nalpha have also been found to be ineffective in early disease.  \nIn patients with advanced or metastatic disease, however, interferon\nalpha can increase survival time despite adverse effects \u2013 most often a\n\u2019flu-like syndrome \u2013 in the majority of patients.(A)  The strongest\nevidence for the effectiveness of interferon comes from two\nrandomised trials.  One compared interferon with\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate in 335 patients and found that those in\nthe interferon group lived 2.5 months (median) longer (p=0.017).(A)\nThe second trial, which randomised 160 patients to vinblastine alone\nor in combination with interferon-alpha, reported median survival\ntimes of 38 weeks with vinblastine alone, compared with 68 weeks\nwith both agents together (p=0.049).(A) \nAround 5% of patients experience complete, and sometimes long-\nlasting, responses to treatment with interferon alpha or interleukin-\n2.(A)  However, spontaneous remission is known to occur\noccasionally in untreated patients.(B)   \nA triple regime which includes interleukin 2, fluorouracil (5-FU) and\ninterferon has been linked with the highest reported response rates\nboth in non-randomised studies and in a randomised controlled trial\nin which it was compared with tamoxifen.(A)  In the latter study,\nmedian survival in the triple-therapy group was 42 months, compared\nwith 14 months in the tamoxifen group (p<0.04).  However, toxicity\nproblems increase when additional agents are given in combination\nwith interferon, and other studies have failed to confirm that\nimproved response rates are associated with enhanced survival.(A) \nResearch into a variety of forms of treatment, particularly combination\ntherapies based on biological agents, is continuing.  \nD. Measurement\nStructure\n\u2022\nSystems to ensure that appropriate patients are promptly\nreferred to the specialist MDT.\n\u2022\nAvailability of immunotherapy for patients with metastatic\ndisease.\nProcess\n\u2022\nEvidence that patients are fully informed and involved in\ndecision-making about treatment. \n97\n9\nOutcome\n\u2022\nOne and five-year survival rates for all patients, with information\non cancer grade and stage, co-morbidity, age and other features\nof case-mix.\n\u2022\nAudit of short-term and long-term adverse effects of treatment.\nE. Resource implications\nNo resource implications specific to the recommendations in this\ntopic have been identified. \n98\n9\nAppendix 1 \nEconomic implications\nof the guidance\nThe cost implications of the urological cancer guidance can be\ndivided into five main categories, listed below.   Three are general\ncategories of relevance to all urological cancers, while the last two are\nsite-specific.\n\u2022\nMultidisciplinary teams (MDTs)\n\u2022\nCentralisation\n\u2022\nSpecialist nurses\n\u2022\nProstate cancer (incidence and other costs)\n\u2022\nBladder cancer (diagnostic testing and treatment)\nThe increase in costs for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with\nkidney, testicular and penile cancers is likely to be small.\nMultidisciplinary teams\nMultidisciplinary team working is intended to ensure that patients\nbenefit from the expertise of a range of specialists for their diagnosis\nand treatment, and that care is given according to recognised\nguidelines.   For some cancers MDTs are well established in most\nTrusts, but for urological cancers even the concept of MDTs is not\nwell-accepted in all Trusts.\nWhile most centres hold regular MDT meetings, many have\ninsufficient time to review all patients.   At units the problems are\nmore severe, with lack of administrative support being a particular\nproblem.   Both units and centres struggle to get a full team together,\nwith the lack of availability of radiologists, pathologists and\noncologists a special problem, exacerbated at units where they may\nonly have visiting clinicians for a session every two weeks.   The cost\nof ensuring that all MDTs have a co-ordinator, and of additional staff\ntime for MDT meetings is estimated to be an additional \u00a36.4 million\nper year.\n99\nA1\nCentralisation\nThe guidance recommends some centralisation of services, in\nparticular requiring that MDTs which undertake radical prostatectomy\nand cystectomy should perform a combined total of at least 50\noperations per year.  Ideally there should be only one team per\nnetwork, covering a population of at least one million people,\nundertaking this type of surgery.  Analysis of the data shows that this\nis a radical change from current practice.\nTo estimate the effect of greater specialisation of services for radical\nprostatectomy and cystectomy, an analysis was undertaken of the\ncurrent (1999/2000) number of operations by hospital, network and\nregion, and an estimate made of the proportion of work that will\nhave to move from units to centres in each network in order to fulfil\nthe requirements of the guidance.  Different configurations are\npossible, so maximum and minimum scenarios were developed to\ncover the likely range.  The central cost estimate is \u00a34.4 million per\nyear, with a range of \u00a33.8 to \u00a35.0 million.\nThe impact on Trusts taking on the work may be significant.\nTypically the number of prostatectomies and cystectomies they will\nundertake will more than double (from around 35 per year) as a\nresult of the guidance, but increasing incidence of prostate cancer and\nmore aggressive treatment of bladder cancer may also considerably\nincrease the demand for these operations.  This may mean that they\nhave to increase their capacity by a factor of four or five, with knock-\non effects on demand for theatre capacity and special care nursing.\nSpecialist nurses\nThe guidance emphasises the need for improved information and\nsupport for urological cancer patients, and the central role that nurse\nspecialists should play in delivering more patient-centred care.\nThe current provision of nurse specialists is patchy.  There are several\nspecialist nurses who are providing the levels of support indicated in\nthe guidance.  However, some are stretched very thinly, being solely\nresponsible for several hundred cancer patients.  Audit data from the\nNorth West Region suggests that many urological cancer patients do\nnot receive counselling from a specialist nurse, and that consequently\nthey may lack significant information about their treatment.  The\nrecent Commission for Health Improvement and Audit Commission\n(CHI/AC) report\n1\nindicates that at the time of the survey (winter\n2000/2001) only around 50% of Trusts providing a urological cancer\n100\nA1\n1\nCommission for Health Improvement, The Audit Commission.  NHS Cancer Care in\nEngland and Wales.  London; 2001. Report No: 1. \nservice had a nurse specialist.  The situation is changing rapidly with\nnurses being appointed, so for the cost estimate it is assumed that it\nis only 30% of Trusts that still require a specialist nurse.  For the 70%\nof Trusts that are assumed to already have at least one nurse it will be\nassumed that on average they need 30% more nursing resource, on\nthe basis that around 30% of specialist urological cancer nurses\nreported severe time constraints on the service that they could\nprovide.\n1\nOn the basis of these assumptions, around 80 more nurse specialists\nwill be required, at an annual cost of \u00a32.68 million.   If it is assumed\nthat these additional nurses will need to complete a post-registration\ndiploma in oncology nursing (ENB 237) the training cost is \u00a30.32\nmillion.\nProstate cancer\nIncidence\nThe greatest increase in the costs of caring for urological cancer\npatients over the next few years is likely to arise from the increasing\nincidence in prostate cancer, rather than in implementing the\nguidance.  This probable increase in incidence is expected as a\nconsequence of many more men being screened for prostate cancer\nwith the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test.  Many urologists believe\nthat it is not just plausible, but probable, that incidence rates in the\nUK will rise to American levels.   Whether incidence will really more\nthan double, and how fast incidence will increase, is very difficult to\npredict.   Currently there is very little hard evidence of an increase in\nincidence, but the latest national figures are for 1998.  The 1998\nfigures do show an increase of 12.6% over 1997, which may signal\nthe start of an upward trend, but could be owing to statistical\nvariation.\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\nHowever, there is evidence that PSA testing increased\nduring the late 1990s, and is likely to have increased further.\nUrologists report seeing many more patients with possible prostate\ncancer, and expect to see even more in the future.\nGiven this uncertainty, three different scenarios were devised.   The\nhighest increase assumes that there has been a steady increase from\n1998 to 2001, but that incidence will then rise more steeply to reach\nAmerican levels by 2004.   This would give an incidence of 45,000 for\nEngland and Wales, compared to approximately 20,500 in 1998.   The\nlow scenario is based on a continuing steady increase from 1998 to\n101\nA1\n2\nQuinn M, Babb P, Brock A, et al.  Cancer trends in England and Wales 1950-1999.\nLondon: Stationery Office, 2001.\n3\nOffice for National Statistics.  New cases of cancer diagnosed in England, 1998.  ONS, 2002.\nAvailable from: http://www.statistics.gov.uk\n4\nWelsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit. Personal Communication. 2002.\n2004, with the central scenario based on mid-point estimates for 2001\nand 2004.  These scenarios give a range of additional costs of \u00a315.4 to\n\u00a343.8 million per year, with a central estimate of \u00a328.2 million.\nOther costs\nThe guidance will result in more patients having magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) prior to radical treatment - not currently routine\npractice for all patients.  This is likely to cost an additional \u00a30.4\nmillion per year.  This cost should be more than offset by the\nreduction in bone scans.  Scans are rarely useful for patients with a\nPSA level of less than 10ng/ml and Gleason score less than 8, but\naudit data suggests that a third of patients with localised cancer\nhaving a scan fall into this category.  The potential annual cost saving\nis \u00a30.5 million.\nThe guidance encourages the use of conformal radiotherapy where\npossible.  Conformal radiotherapy requires more consultant\noncologist, radiographer and medical physicist time than conventional\nexternal beam radiotherapy.  Assuming that machines are provided,\nthe ongoing additional cost of providing all patients with conformal\nradiotherapy is modest, at \u00a30.2 million per year.  This total annual\ncost assumes cost savings resulting from the phasing out of the use of\nthe low melting point alloy method of providing conformal\nradiotherapy, which is more laborious, and therefore more expensive,\nthan conformal radiotherapy with multileaf collimators.\nBladder cancer\nAudit and HES data show that patients are being more actively treated\nfor bladder cancer than a few years ago, but that there is still a need\nfor further improvement.  Increased treatment costs will be incurred\nas a result of the guidance.  Additional intravesical chemotherapy for\nsuperficial cancers will cost \u00a32.0 million, and an additional 850\ncystectomies a year may be required, at a cost of \u00a33.9 million.\n102\nA1\nCost Summary\n(All costs in millions of pounds per year)\nMultidisciplinary teams\nMDT co-ordinator for all units and additional \nconsultant sessions\n\u00a33.56\nAdditional costs of staff time at units and centres \n\u00a32.84\nSubtotal\n\u00a36.40\nCentralisation \u2013 central \n\u00a34.39\nLow scenario\n\u00a33.79\nHigh scenario\n\u00a34.98\nPatient-centred care (specialist nurses)\n\u00a32.68\nProstate cancer\nPotential increase in prostate cancer incidence\n\u00a328.19\nLow scenario\n\u00a315.40\nHigh scenario\n\u00a343.84\nMRI prior to radical treatment\n\u00a30.37\nLow scenario\n\u00a30.23\nHigh scenario\n\u00a30.40\nConformal radiotherapy for radical treatment\n\u00a30.16\nLow scenario\n\u00a30.10\nHigh scenario\n\u00a30.17\nBone scans \n-\u00a30.53\nLow scenario\n-\u00a30.34\nHigh scenario\n-\u00a30.58\nBladder cancer\nDiagnosis \u00a30.28\nTreatment\n\u00a35.93\nSubtotal\n\u00a36.21\nTotal\n\u00a347.87\nRange\n\u00a334.47 - \u00a364.10\n103\nA1\nAppendix 2\nHow this guidance\nmanual was produced\nThe Manuals in this series are intended to guide health organisations\n(strategic health authorities, primary care Trusts, cancer networks, and\nTrusts), their managers and lead clinicians in improving the\neffectiveness and efficiency of services for patients with cancer. The\ninformation and recommendations in the Manual are based on\nsystematic reviews of the best available evidence on diagnosis,\ntreatment and service delivery. This evidence is assessed by experts\nand the recommendations are the product of extensive discussion\nwith leading clinical specialists. The production process is described\nbriefly below; more detail is available in earlier guidance Manuals in\nthe series.\nThe production process begins with a two-day residential event\nwhere proposals for improving services for patients with cancer of a\nspecific site are generated. A large group of relevant health care\nprofessionals, people with personal experience of the particular type\nof cancer being considered, health care commissioners and academics\nfrom around the country, meet to put forward structured proposals\nbased on their experience and knowledge of the research literature.\nAll proposals share a common structure and are intended to improve\noutcomes for patients.  These proposals are then sent to referees,\nincluding clinicians, academics, representatives of health authorities,\nthe Department of Health, patient organisations, and relevant\ncharities, many of whom make detailed comments and suggestions.\nSystematic reviews of the research literature, designed to evaluate the\nproposals, are then carried out or commissioned by the NHS Centre\nfor Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) at the University of York.\nThis process culminates in the production of two large sources of\ninformation, one with a practical or operational focus, and the other\ncontaining detailed research evidence on effectiveness. The guidance\ndraws on both these sources, with added input from commissioners,\npatients, and experts in the particular fields. The writing of the\nguidance manual is overseen by an editorial group chaired by\nProfessor Bob Haward, accountable to the National Cancer Guidance\nSteering Group. The writing is undertaken by Dr Arabella Melville, in\nconjunction with CRD.\n104\nA2\n105\nA2\nComplementary research, designed to quantify the potential cost of\nmajor changes in services, is carried out by the School of Health and\nRelated Research at the University of Sheffield. This work involves\nliterature searching, interviews with clinicians and managers, and\nanalyses of costs.\nEvidence grading\nThe reliability and quality of evidence which supports the\nrecommendations in the guidance manual is graded throughout the\ndocument. The grades are as follows:\nA.\nEvidence derived from randomised controlled trials or systematic\nreviews of randomised trials.\nB.\nEvidence from non-randomised controlled trials or observational\nstudies.\nC.\nProfessional consensus.\nThe quality of research evidence forms a continuum and there is\noverlap between these categories. Most of the published research on\ncancer focuses on clinical evaluations of treatment; little direct\nresearch has been carried out on the organisation and delivery of\nservices, issues on which randomised controlled trials (categorised\nhere as the highest quality evidence) may not be feasible. Research\ndesigns which might be regarded as of relatively poor quality for\nevaluating a clinical intervention may therefore be the most reliable\navailable for assessing the organisational issues.\nThe systematic reviews used to inform the Manual are summarised in\nthe document  Improving Outcomes in Urological Cancers: The\nResearch Evidence .  This document includes details of all the studies\nto which the Manual refers.  It is available on the CD-rom provided\nwith this Manual, and can be purchased in printed format as a CRD\nreport (email: \ncrdpub@york.ac.uk\n, tel: 01904-433648).\nAppendix 3 \nPeople and
